  1  1    Section 1.  Section 280.13C, Code 2018, is amended by
  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.
  2  6    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2  7    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2  8    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2  9 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 10    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 11 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 12 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 13    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 14 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 15 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 16 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 17    3.  Training.
  2 18    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 19 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 20 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 21 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 22 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.
  2 31    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  2 32    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 33 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 34 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  2 35 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  1 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt
  4  1 such protocols.
  4  2    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4  3 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4  4 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4  5 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4  6 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4  7 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4  8 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4  9 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 11 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 12 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the
  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts
  4 29 or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing
  4 30 violation of the law.
  4 31    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete
  4 32 training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as enacted
  4 33 by this Act, has until July 1, 2019, to initially complete such
  4 34 training.
  4 35    Sec. 3.  STATE MANDATE FUNDING SPECIFIED.  In accordance
  5  1 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring
  5  2 compliance with any state mandate included in this division
  5  3 of this Act shall be paid by a school district from state
  5  4 school foundation aid received by the school district under
  5  5 section 257.16.  This specification of the payment of the state
  5  6 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  5  7 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  8 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  5  9 this Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected
  5 10 school districts.
  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

 A BILL FOR

  1 An Act providing for brain injury policies for certain
  2    extracurricular interscholastic activities, and including
  3    applicability provisions.
  4 BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF IOWA:
    TLSB 5331YH (6) 87

PAG LIN



  1  1    Section 1.  Section 280.13C, Code 2018, is amended by
  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.
  2  6    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2  7    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2  8    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2  9 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 10    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 11 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 12 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 13    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 14 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 15 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 16 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 17    3.  Training.
  2 18    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 19 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 20 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 21 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 22 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.
  2 31    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  2 32    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 33 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 34 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  2 35 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  1 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt
  4  1 such protocols.
  4  2    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4  3 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4  4 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4  5 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4  6 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4  7 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4  8 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4  9 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 11 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 12 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the
  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts
  4 29 or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing
  4 30 violation of the law.
  4 31    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete
  4 32 training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as enacted
  4 33 by this Act, has until July 1, 2019, to initially complete such
  4 34 training.
  4 35    Sec. 3.  STATE MANDATE FUNDING SPECIFIED.  In accordance
  5  1 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring
  5  2 compliance with any state mandate included in this division
  5  3 of this Act shall be paid by a school district from state
  5  4 school foundation aid received by the school district under
  5  5 section 257.16.  This specification of the payment of the state
  5  6 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  5  7 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  8 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  5  9 this Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected
  5 10 school districts.
  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  2 18    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 19 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic

  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,

  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa

  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt

  4  7 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4  8 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4  9 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa

  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the
  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts

  5  7 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  8 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  5  9 this Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected
  5 10 school districts.
  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

PAG LIN



  1  1    Section 1.  Section 280.13C, Code 2018, is amended by
  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.
  2  6    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2  7    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2  8    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2  9 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 10    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 11 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 12 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 13    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 14 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 15 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 16 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 17    3.  Training.
  2 18    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 19 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 20 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 21 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 22 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.
  2 31    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  2 32    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 33 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 34 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  2 35 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  1 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt
  4  1 such protocols.
  4  2    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4  3 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4  4 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4  5 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4  6 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4  7 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4  8 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4  9 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 11 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 12 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the
  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts
  4 29 or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing
  4 30 violation of the law.
  4 31    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete
  4 32 training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as enacted
  4 33 by this Act, has until July 1, 2019, to initially complete such
  4 34 training.
  4 35    Sec. 3.  STATE MANDATE FUNDING SPECIFIED.  In accordance
  5  1 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring
  5  2 compliance with any state mandate included in this division
  5  3 of this Act shall be paid by a school district from state
  5  4 school foundation aid received by the school district under
  5  5 section 257.16.  This specification of the payment of the state
  5  6 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  5  7 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  8 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  5  9 this Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected
  5 10 school districts.
  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular

  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state

  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a

  2 18    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 19 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 20 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 21 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 22 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,

  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion

  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular

  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt

  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the

  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.

  5  7 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  8 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  5  9 this Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected
  5 10 school districts.
  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

PAG LIN



  1  1    Section 1.  Section 280.13C, Code 2018, is amended by
  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.
  2  6    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2  7    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2  8    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2  9 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 10    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 11 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 12 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 13    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 14 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 15 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 16 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 17    3.  Training.
  2 18    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 19 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 20 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 21 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 22 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.
  2 31    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  2 32    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 33 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 34 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  2 35 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  1 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt
  4  1 such protocols.
  4  2    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4  3 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4  4 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4  5 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4  6 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4  7 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4  8 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4  9 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 11 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 12 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the
  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts
  4 29 or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing
  4 30 violation of the law.
  4 31    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete
  4 32 training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as enacted
  4 33 by this Act, has until July 1, 2019, to initially complete such
  4 34 training.
  4 35    Sec. 3.  STATE MANDATE FUNDING SPECIFIED.  In accordance
  5  1 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring
  5  2 compliance with any state mandate included in this division
  5  3 of this Act shall be paid by a school district from state
  5  4 school foundation aid received by the school district under
  5  5 section 257.16.  This specification of the payment of the state
  5  6 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  5  7 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  8 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  5  9 this Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected
  5 10 school districts.
  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and

  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.
  2  6    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2  7    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2  8    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2  9 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 10    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 11 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 12 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.

  2 14 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 15 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 16 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 17    3.  Training.
  2 18    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 19 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 20 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 21 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 22 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.
  2 31    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  2 32    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 33 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 34 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  2 35 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  1 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt
  4  1 such protocols.

  4  6 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4  7 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4  8 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4  9 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 11 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school

  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the
  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts
  4 29 or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing
  4 30 violation of the law.
  4 31    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete

  5  3 of this Act shall be paid by a school district from state
  5  4 school foundation aid received by the school district under
  5  5 section 257.16.  This specification of the payment of the state
  5  6 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  5  7 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  8 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  5  9 this Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected
  5 10 school districts.
  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  1  1    Section 1.  Section 280.13C, Code 2018, is amended by
  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.
  2  6    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2  7    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2  8    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2  9 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 10    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 11 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 12 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 13    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 14 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 15 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 16 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.

  2 18    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 19 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 20 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 21 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 22 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.
  2 31    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  2 32    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 33 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 34 union shall work together to distribute the centers for

  3  1 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt
  4  1 such protocols.
  4  2    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4  3 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4  4 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4  5 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4  6 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4  7 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4  8 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4  9 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 11 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 12 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the
  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without

  5  1 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring
  5  2 compliance with any state mandate included in this division
  5  3 of this Act shall be paid by a school district from state
  5  4 school foundation aid received by the school district under
  5  5 section 257.16.  This specification of the payment of the state
  5  6 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  5  7 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  8 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  5  9 this Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected

  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in

  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the

  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic

  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing

  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  1  1    Section 1.  Section 280.13C, Code 2018, is amended by
  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.
  2  6    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2  7    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2  8    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2  9 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 10    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 11 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 12 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 13    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 14 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 15 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 16 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 17    3.  Training.
  2 18    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 19 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 20 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 21 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 22 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.
  2 31    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  2 32    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 33 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 34 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  2 35 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  1 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt
  4  1 such protocols.
  4  2    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4  3 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4  4 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4  5 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4  6 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4  7 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4  8 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4  9 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 11 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 12 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the
  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts
  4 29 or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing
  4 30 violation of the law.
  4 31    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete
  4 32 training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as enacted
  4 33 by this Act, has until July 1, 2019, to initially complete such
  4 34 training.
  4 35    Sec. 3.  STATE MANDATE FUNDING SPECIFIED.  In accordance
  5  1 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring
  5  2 compliance with any state mandate included in this division
  5  3 of this Act shall be paid by a school district from state
  5  4 school foundation aid received by the school district under
  5  5 section 257.16.  This specification of the payment of the state
  5  6 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  5  7 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  8 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  5  9 this Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected
  5 10 school districts.
  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  1  1    Section 1.  Section 280.13C, Code 2018, is amended by
  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.
  2  6    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2  7    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2  8    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2  9 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 10    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 11 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 12 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 13    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 14 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 15 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 16 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 17    3.  Training.
  2 18    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 19 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 20 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 21 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 22 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.
  2 31    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  2 32    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 33 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 34 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  2 35 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  1 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt
  4  1 such protocols.
  4  2    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4  3 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4  4 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4  5 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4  6 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4  7 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4  8 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4  9 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 11 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 12 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the
  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts
  4 29 or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing
  4 30 violation of the law.
  4 31    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete
  4 32 training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as enacted
  4 33 by this Act, has until July 1, 2019, to initially complete such
  4 34 training.
  4 35    Sec. 3.  STATE MANDATE FUNDING SPECIFIED.  In accordance
  5  1 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring
  5  2 compliance with any state mandate included in this division
  5  3 of this Act shall be paid by a school district from state
  5  4 school foundation aid received by the school district under
  5  5 section 257.16.  This specification of the payment of the state
  5  6 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  5  7 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  8 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  5  9 this Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected
  5 10 school districts.
  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in

  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.

  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  4 12 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the
  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts
  4 29 or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing

  5  3 of this Act shall be paid by a school district from state
  5  4 school foundation aid received by the school district under
  5  5 section 257.16.  This specification of the payment of the state
  5  6 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  5  7 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  8 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  5  9 this Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected
  5 10 school districts.
  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  1  2 striking the section and inserting in lieu thereof the
  1  3 following:
  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.
  2  6    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2  7    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2  8    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2  9 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 10    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 11 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 12 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 13    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 14 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 15 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 16 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 17    3.  Training.
  2 18    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 19 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 20 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 21 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 22 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.
  2 31    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  2 32    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 33 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 34 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  2 35 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  1 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt
  4  1 such protocols.
  4  2    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4  3 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4  4 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4  5 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4  6 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4  7 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4  8 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4  9 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 11 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 12 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the
  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts
  4 29 or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing
  4 30 violation of the law.
  4 31    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete
  4 32 training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as enacted
  4 33 by this Act, has until July 1, 2019, to initially complete such
  4 34 training.
  4 35    Sec. 3.  STATE MANDATE FUNDING SPECIFIED.  In accordance
  5  1 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring

  5  7 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  8 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  5  9 this Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected
  5 10 school districts.

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.

  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill

  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa

  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa

  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt

  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the

  5  6 cost shall be deemed to meet all of the state funding=related
  5  7 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  8 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  5  9 this Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected
  5 10 school districts.
  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  1  4    280.13C  Concussion and brain injury policies.
  1  5    1.  Legislative findings.  The general assembly finds and
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.
  2  6    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2  7    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2  8    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2  9 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 10    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 11 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 12 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 13    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 14 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 15 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 16 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 17    3.  Training.
  2 18    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 19 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 20 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 21 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 22 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.
  2 31    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  2 32    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 33 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 34 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  2 35 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  1 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt
  4  1 such protocols.
  4  2    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4  3 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4  4 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4  5 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4  6 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4  7 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4  8 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4  9 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 11 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 12 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the
  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts
  4 29 or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing
  4 30 violation of the law.
  4 31    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete

  4 33 by this Act, has until July 1, 2019, to initially complete such
  4 34 training.
  4 35    Sec. 3.  STATE MANDATE FUNDING SPECIFIED.  In accordance
  5  1 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in

  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the

  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and

  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.

  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.
       LSB 5331YH (6) 87
       je/rj
  1  6 declares all of the following:
  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.
  2  6    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2  7    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2  8    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2  9 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 10    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 11 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 12 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 13    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 14 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 15 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 16 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.

  2 20 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 21 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 22 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.

  3  1 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high

  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt
  4  1 such protocols.

  4  6 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4  7 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students

  4  9 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 11 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 12 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the

  1  7    a.  Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
  1  8 injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports
  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.
  2  6    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2  7    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2  8    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2  9 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 10    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 11 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 12 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 13    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 14 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 15 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 16 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.
  2 17    3.  Training.
  2 18    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 19 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 20 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 21 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 22 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.
  2 31    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  2 32    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 33 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 34 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  2 35 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  1 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt
  4  1 such protocols.
  4  2    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on
  4  3 or after July 1, 2018, the board of directors of each school
  4  4 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4  5 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4  6 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4  7 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4  8 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4  9 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 11 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 12 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the
  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts
  4 29 or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing
  4 30 violation of the law.
  4 31    Sec. 2.  APPLICABILITY.  A person required to complete
  4 32 training pursuant to section 280.13C, subsection 3, as enacted
  4 33 by this Act, has until July 1, 2019, to initially complete such
  4 34 training.
  4 35    Sec. 3.  STATE MANDATE FUNDING SPECIFIED.  In accordance

  5  7 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  8 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of
  5  9 this Act by and enforcement of this Act against all affected

  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  1  9 and recreational activities. A concussion is caused by a blow
  1 10 or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move
  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.
  2  6    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2  7    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.
  2  8    b.  "Contest official" means a referee, umpire, judge, or
  2  9 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 10    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 11 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 12 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 13    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 14 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse

  2 18    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 19 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 20 union shall work together to develop training materials and
  2 21 courses regarding concussions and brain injuries, including
  2 22 training regarding evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks,
  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.
  2 31    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  2 32    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 33 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 34 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  2 35 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  1 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt
  4  1 such protocols.

  4  4 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4  5 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate

  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the
  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts
  4 29 or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing

  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating

  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each

  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from

  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,

  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular

  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state

  1 11 rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or
  1 12 death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not
  1 13 properly evaluated and managed.
  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.
  2  6    2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this section:
  2  7    a.  "Contest" means an interscholastic athletic game.

  2  9 other official in an athletic contest.
  2 10    c.  "Extracurricular interscholastic activity" means any
  2 11 extracurricular interscholastic activity, contest, or practice,
  2 12 including sports, dance, or cheerleading.
  2 13    d.  "Licensed health care provider" means a physician,
  2 14 physician assistant, chiropractor, advanced registered nurse
  2 15 practitioner, nurse, physical therapist, or athletic trainer
  2 16 licensed by a board designated under section 147.13.

  2 18    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 19 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic

  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.
  2 31    4.  Guidelines and information sheet.
  2 32    a.  The department of public health, Iowa high school
  2 33 athletic association, and the Iowa girls high school athletic
  2 34 union shall work together to distribute the centers for
  2 35 disease control and prevention guidelines and other pertinent
  3  1 information to inform and educate coaches, students, and
  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt
  4  1 such protocols.
  4  2    7.  Protective gear.  For school budget years beginning on

  4  4 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4  5 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4  6 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a
  4  7 contest in grades seven through twelve shall provide students
  4  8 participating in such contests with any protective gear,
  4  9 including but not limited to helmets and pads required for the
  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 11 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 12 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual
  4 14 student needs but that is not required for participation in the
  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 21 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of the
  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts
  4 29 or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing
  4 30 violation of the law.

  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  1 14    b.  Concussions are a type of brain injury that can range
  1 15 from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally
  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or
  1 18 from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with
  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.

  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days

  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa

  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular

  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes

  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt

  4  4 district and the authorities in charge of each accredited
  4  5 nonpublic school with enrolled students who participate
  4  6 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity which is a

  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa

  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that

  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts
  4 29 or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing

  5  4 school foundation aid received by the school district under
  5  5 section 257.16.  This specification of the payment of the state

  5  7 requirements of section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional
  5  8 state funding shall be necessary for the full implementation of

  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  1 16 works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized
  1 17 sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or

  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.

  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.

  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent

  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt

  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that

  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without
  4 26 compensation for a school district or accredited nonpublic
  4 27 school under this section shall not be liable for any claim for
  4 28 injuries or damages arising out of such care except for acts
  4 29 or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing
  4 30 violation of the law.

  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  1 19 obstacles. Concussions can occur with or without loss of
  1 20 consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur
  1 21 without loss of consciousness.
  1 22    c.  Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms of a
  1 23 head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to
  1 24 greater injury and even death. The general assembly recognizes
  1 25 that, despite having generally recognized return=to=play
  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.
  1 30    d.  A student athlete who has sustained a concussion may
  1 31 need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of
  1 32 curriculum, and monitoring by medical or educational staff
  1 33 until the student is fully recovered. To that end, the
  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on
  2  3 peer=reviewed scientific evidence consistent with federal
  2  4 guidelines. Furthermore, all schools in this state shall adopt
  2  5 such protocols.

  2 23 and long=term effects of concussions and brain injuries.  Each
  2 24 coach or contest official shall complete such training at least
  2 25 every two years.
  2 26    b.  Individuals required to complete training pursuant to
  2 27 this subsection shall submit proof of such completion to the
  2 28 board of directors of the school district or the authorities in
  2 29 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within thirty days
  2 30 of such completion.

  3  2 the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  3  3 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  3  4 injury, including the danger of continuing to participate in
  3  5 extracurricular interscholastic activities after suffering a
  3  6 concussion or brain injury and their responsibility to report
  3  7 such signs, symptoms, and behaviors if they occur.
  3  8    b.  Annually, each school district and nonpublic school shall
  3  9 provide to the parent or guardian of each student a concussion
  3 10 and brain injury information sheet, as provided by the Iowa
  3 11 high school athletic association and the Iowa girls high
  3 12 school athletic union. The student and the student's parent
  3 13 or guardian shall sign and return a copy of the concussion
  3 14 and brain injury information sheet to the student's school
  3 15 prior to the student's participation in any extracurricular
  3 16 interscholastic activity.
  3 17    5.  Removal from participation.  If a student's coach,
  3 18 contest official, or licensed health care provider observes
  3 19 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion or
  3 20 brain injury in an extracurricular interscholastic activity,
  3 21 the student shall be immediately removed from participation.
  3 22    6.  Return=to=play protocols.  The department of public
  3 23 health, Iowa high school athletic association, and the Iowa
  3 24 girls high school athletic union shall work together to
  3 25 develop a return=to=play protocol, based on peer=reviewed
  3 26 scientific evidence consistent with the guidelines of the
  3 27 centers for disease control and prevention of the United States
  3 28 department of health and human services, for a student's
  3 29 return to participation in an extracurricular interscholastic
  3 30 activity after showing signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent
  3 31 with a concussion or brain injury. The board of directors
  3 32 of each school district and the authorities in charge of
  3 33 each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled students who
  3 34 participate in an extracurricular interscholastic activity
  3 35 which is a contest in grades seven through twelve shall adopt
  4  1 such protocols.

  4 10 activity by law, by the rules for such contests, or by Iowa
  4 11 high school athletic association or Iowa girls high school
  4 12 athletic union guidelines. However, an individual student
  4 13 is responsible for other protective gear that the individual

  4 15 contest as provided in this subsection.
  4 16    8.  Liability.
  4 17    a.  A school district or accredited nonpublic school that
  4 18 fully implements the protocols required by this section and
  4 19 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  4 20 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for

  4 22 licensed health care provider present at the extracurricular
  4 23 interscholastic activity at the request of the school district
  4 24 or accredited nonpublic school.
  4 25    b.  A licensed health care provider providing care without

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the

  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each

  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular

  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  1 26 standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected
  1 27 youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in
  1 28 actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes
  1 29 in this state.

  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the

  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with

  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.

  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  1 34 department of public health, in coordination with the Iowa high
  1 35 school athletic association and the Iowa girls high school
  2  1 athletic union, shall establish and disseminate to all schools
  2  2 in this state a return=to=school protocol that is based on

  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating

  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through

  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective

  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification

  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state

  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating

  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls

  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through

  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective

  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state

  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating

  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls

  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through

  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective

  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as

  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the

  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic

  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a

  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of

  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or

  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating

  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such

  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each

  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating

  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such

  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the

  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the

  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating

  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls

  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,

  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.

  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school

  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the

  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state

  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  5 11                           EXPLANATION
  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the
  5 31 centers for disease control and prevention guidelines and other
  5 32 pertinent information to inform and educate coaches, students,
  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or
  7  9 accredited nonpublic school under the bill shall not be liable
  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the

  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each

  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of

  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required

  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating

  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective

  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state

  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.

  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating

  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating
  5 15 to concussion and brain injury policies and creates new Code
  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls
  5 19 high school athletic  union (IGHSAU) to work together to develop
  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in
  5 25 charge of the accredited nonpublic school within 30 days of
  5 26 such completion. The bill provides that a person required to
  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the

  5 33 and the parents and guardians of students of the risks, signs,
  5 34 symptoms, and behaviors consistent with a concussion or brain
  5 35 injury. The bill requires each school district and nonpublic
  6  1 school to annually provide to the parent or guardian of each
  6  2 student a concussion and brain injury information sheet, as
  6  3 provided by the department of public health, the IHSAA, and the
  6  4 IGHSAU.  The bill requires the student and the student's parent
  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,
  6 14 the IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to develop a
  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular
  7  2 interscholastic activity shall not be liable for any claim for
  7  3 injuries or damages based upon the actions or inactions of
  7  4 the provider present at the extracurricular interscholastic
  7  5 activity at the request of the school district or nonpublic
  7  6 school.
  7  7    The bill provides that a licensed health care provider
  7  8 providing care without compensation for a school district or

  7 10 for any claim for injuries or damages arising out of such
  7 11 care except for acts or omissions which involve intentional
  7 12 misconduct or knowing violation of the law.
  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  5 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating

  5 16 section 280.13C relating to the same subject.
  5 17    The bill requires the department of public health, the Iowa
  5 18 high school athletic association (IHSAA), and the Iowa girls

  5 20 training materials and courses regarding concussions and brain
  5 21 injuries. The bill requires each coach or contest official
  5 22 to complete such training at least every two years. The bill
  5 23 requires individuals required to complete training to submit
  5 24 proof of such completion to the school board or authorities in

  5 27 complete such training has until July 1, 2019, to initially
  5 28 complete the training.
  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the
  5 30 IHSAA, and the IGHSAU to work together to distribute the

  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,

  6 15 return=to=play protocol for a student's return to participation
  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and

  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of

  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
  7 23 mandates included in the bill.

  5 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 14    This bill strikes current Code section 280.13C relating

  5 29    The bill requires the department of public health, the

  6  5 or guardian to sign and return the information sheet to the
  6  6 student's school prior to the student's participation in any
  6  7 extracurricular interscholastic activity.
  6  8    The bill requires that a student be immediately removed from
  6  9 participation in an extracurricular interscholastic activity if
  6 10 the student's coach, contest official, or licensed health care
  6 11 provider observes signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with
  6 12 a concussion or brain injury.
  6 13    The bill requires the department of public health,

  6 16 in an extracurricular interscholastic activity after showing
  6 17 signs, symptoms, or behaviors consistent with a concussion
  6 18 or brain injury. The bill requires the school board and the
  6 19 authorities in charge of each accredited nonpublic school
  6 20 with enrolled students who participate in an extracurricular
  6 21 interscholastic activity which is a contest in grades 7 through
  6 22 12 to adopt such protocols.
  6 23    The bill requires the school board and the authorities
  6 24 in charge of each accredited nonpublic school with enrolled
  6 25 students who participate in an extracurricular interscholastic
  6 26 activity which is a contest in grades 7 through 12, for school
  6 27 budget years beginning July 1, 2018, to provide students
  6 28 participating in such contests with any protective gear
  6 29 required for the activity by law, by the rules for such
  6 30 contests, or by IHSAA or IGHSAU guidelines. The bill provides
  6 31 that an individual student is responsible for other protective
  6 32 gear that the individual student needs but that is not required
  6 33 for participation in the contest as provided in the bill.
  6 34    The bill provides that a school district or nonpublic school
  6 35 that fully implements the protocols required by the bill and
  7  1 provides a licensed health care provider at an extracurricular

  7 13    The bill provides legislative findings.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  7 16 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  7 17 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  7 18 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  7 19 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
  7 20 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
  7 21 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
  7 22 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
