  2 13    1.  A local government that holds a legal or equitable
  2 14 interest in agricultural land shall not enter into a lease
  2 15 with another person, if the person may use the agricultural
  2 16 land for farming, unless the lease is in writing and a farm
  2 17 unit agreement is made part of the lease.  The parties to
  2 18 the agreement shall be the lessee and the soil and water
  2 19 conservation commissioners of the district where the land is
  2 20 located.
  2 21    2.  The farm unit agreement shall apply to the same farm unit
  2 22 as an applicable farm unit conservation plan or conservation
  2 23 agreement.  The agreement may be made part of a farm unit
  2 24 conservation plan or soil conservation agreement.  A farm unit
  2 25 agreement may cover one or more farm units as specified in the
  2 26 agreement so long as all farm units are located as part of the
  2 27 same district.  The agreement shall identify those soil and
  2 28 water conservation practices, water quality practices, farming
  2 29 practices, and soil health practices that best prevent soil
  2 30 loss, manage nutrients, reduce contributing contaminant loads
  2 31 to receiving surface water, and promote soil health.
  2 32    3.  The farm unit agreement shall be completed on forms
  2 33 prepared by the division in consultation with the Iowa nutrient
  2 34 research center established pursuant to section 466B.47.
  2 35    4.  The commissioners of the district shall assist the
  3  1 parties to the lease in developing a farm unit agreement.  The
  3  2 commissioners shall respond to a request by a local government
  3  3 to develop a farm unit agreement within sixty days of receiving
  3  4 the request.  The lessee shall file the agreement with the
  3  5 commissioners subject to their approval.  The commissioners
  3  6 shall deliver a copy of the agreement to the division.  Each
  3  7 year, an updated agreement must be approved and filed in the
  3  8 same manner as the original agreement.
  3  9    5.  If a farm unit agreement is not filed as required in this
  3 10 section, the lease shall be void in sixty days.
  3 11    6.  The commissioners shall inspect or cause to be inspected
  3 12 land covered by a farm unit agreement if reasonable grounds
  3 13 exist to believe that a failure to comply with the agreement
  3 14 is occurring. If the commissioners determine a failure is
  3 15 occurring, a notice of that finding shall be delivered to the
  3 16 parties to the lease.  The notice shall describe the land
  3 17 affected and shall describe the failure.  The notice shall also
  3 18 describe the corrective action required and the time limit for
  3 19 commencing and accomplishing such action.
  3 20    7.  If corrective action has not been commenced or
  3 21 accomplished as described in the notice, the commissioners
  3 22 shall issue an administrative order to the person who filed
  3 23 the farm unit agreement.  The administrative order shall
  3 24 address the same subjects provided in the notice.  However, the
  3 25 corrective action must be commenced not more than six months
  3 26 after the date the order is issued and must be completed not
  3 27 more than one year after that date.
  3 28    8.  a.  The commissioners shall petition the district court
  3 29 to issue an order requiring immediate compliance with an
  3 30 administrative order if the commissioners have determined any
  3 31 of the following:
  3 32    (1)  The corrective action has not been commenced or
  3 33 completed by the date specified in the administrative order.
  3 34    (2)  The corrective action has been commenced but is not
  3 35 being performed with due diligence or in a manner that will
  4  1 reasonably result in compliance with the administrative order.
  4  2    b.  The district court may grant injunctive relief necessary
  4  3 in order to enforce the terms and conditions of the agreement.
  4  4 Alternatively, district court may void the lease.  If a lease
  4  5 is voided, the local government shall have any remedy available
  4  6 to a lessor who brings an action against a lessee for the
  4  7 wrongful termination of a lease.
  4  8    9.  This section shall not apply if the duration of the lease
  4  9 is for less than sixty days.  However, this section shall apply
  4 10 if the local government and the same person enter into multiple
  4 11 subsequent leases that involve the same tract of land.
  4 12    Sec. 3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.2, subsection
  4 13 3, shall not apply to this Act.
  4 14                           EXPLANATION
  4 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 17    This bill requires a farm unit agreement be executed when any
  4 18 lease is entered into by a local government and a person who
  4 19 may use the leased land for farming purposes.  The agreement
  4 20 requires the lessee to comply with applicable soil and water
  4 21 conservation practices, farming practices, water quality
  4 22 practices, and soil health practices during the period of the
  4 23 lease.  The agreement must be developed in cooperation with
  4 24 the commissioners of the soil and water conservation district
  4 25 where the land is located who are parties to the agreement.
  4 26 The  commissioners may conduct inspections to ensure compliance
  4 27 with the agreement and take administrative or judicial action
  4 28 to enforce its provisions. The bill does not apply to a lease
  4 29 that is for less than 60 days unless the local government and
  4 30 the same person have entered into multiple subsequent leases
  4 31 involving the same land.
  4 32    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  4 33 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  4 34 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  4 35 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  5  1 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  5  2 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  5  3 mandate included in the bill.
