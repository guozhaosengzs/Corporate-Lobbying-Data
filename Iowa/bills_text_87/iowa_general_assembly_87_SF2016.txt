  3 15                           EXPLANATION
  3 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 18    This bill provides that the department of transportation
  3 19 (DOT) may issue a special interest motor vehicle registration
  3 20 plate to the owner of a motor vehicle subject to registration
  3 21 under Code section 321.109(1), motor truck, motor home, or
  3 22 multipurpose vehicle, if the vehicle is collected, preserved,
  3 23 restored, or maintained by the owner as a leisure pursuit and
  3 24 the vehicle is not used for general transportation of persons
  3 25 or property. The bill requires special interest plates to be
  3 26 designed by the DOT, to contain the words "special interest",
  3 27 and to exclude from the plate the name of the county where the
  3 28 vehicle is registered.
  3 29    The special fee for a letter=number designated special
  3 30 interest plate is $50. The fee for a personalized special
  3 31 interest plate is $25 which must be paid in addition to the
  3 32 special fee of $50. The annual special fee for a letter=number
  3 33 designated special interest plate is $50, which must be paid in
  3 34 addition to the regular annual registration fee. The annual
  3 35 fee for a personalized special interest plate is $5, which must
  4  1 be paid in addition to the annual special fee and the regular
  4  2 annual registration fee. The bill requires the special fees
  4  3 collected by the DOT under the bill to be paid monthly to the
  4  4 treasurer of state and deposited in the road use tax fund.
  4  5    The bill provides that upon receipt of the special interest
  4  6 plate, the applicant must surrender the applicant's current
  4  7 registration plates to the county treasurer. The county
  4  8 treasurer must validate the special interest plate in the same
  4  9 manner as regular registration plates are validated.
  4 10    The bill prohibits a person from operating a motor vehicle
  4 11 displaying a special interest plate on the public streets
  4 12 or highways of this state other than for public displays,
  4 13 parades, related pleasure or hobby activities, or occasional
  4 14 transportation not related to the person's business or
  4 15 occupation. By operation of law, a violation of this provision
  4 16 is a simple misdemeanor (Code section 321.482). A simple
  4 17 misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at least $65 but not to
  4 18 exceed $625 and imprisonment not to exceed 30 days.
  4 19    The bill requires the special interest plate issued for a
