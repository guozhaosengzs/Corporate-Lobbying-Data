  3 11                           EXPLANATION
  3 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 14    This bill prohibits a person from operating a motor vehicle
  3 15 while using a mobile telephone unless the mobile telephone
  3 16 is specifically designed and configured to allow hands=free
  3 17 listening and talking and is used in that manner.  The bill
  3 18 does not apply to the operator of a motor vehicle when the
  3 19 motor vehicle is at a complete stop off the roadway.  In
  3 20 addition, the bill exempts the following persons from the
  3 21 prohibition:  a member of a public safety agency performing
  3 22 official duties; a health care professional in the course of
  3 23 an emergency situation; and a person receiving safety=related
  3 24 information including emergency, traffic, or weather alerts.
  3 25 These are the same exemptions that apply under current law for
  3 26 text=messaging while driving.
  3 27    The bill defines "mobile telephone" to mean the same
  3 28 as defined in federal motor carrier safety administration
  3 29 regulations.  Under that definition, "mobile telephone" means
  3 30 a mobile communication device that falls under or uses any
  3 31 commercial mobile radio service, as defined in regulations of
  3 32 the federal communications commission.  The federal definition
  3 33 explicitly excludes two=way or citizens band radio services.
  3 34    The bill amends current provisions prohibiting
  3 35 text=messaging while driving to specify that a person does not
  4  1 violate the text=messaging provisions by using a fixed unit
  4  2 global positioning system or navigation system, provided the
  4  3 person does not enter data into the system while operating
  4  4 the motor vehicle.  "Fixed unit global positioning system or
  4  5 navigation system" is defined as an electronic device mounted
  4  6 inside a motor vehicle and capable of providing navigation
  4  7 directions to a driver based on data entered into the device.
  4  8 The bill also strikes a current exception to the prohibition
  4  9 on text=messaging while driving which applies to a person
  4 10 selecting or entering a telephone number or name in a hand=held
  4 11 mobile telephone or activating, deactivating, or initiating a
  4 12 function of a hand=held mobile telephone.
  4 13    A person who uses a mobile telephone while operating a motor
  4 14 vehicle in violation of the bill commits a simple misdemeanor
  4 15 punishable by a scheduled fine of $100.  The offense is not
  4 16 a moving violation, and therefore cannot be considered for
  4 17 purposes of administrative suspension of a driver's license
  4 18 or to establish habitual offender status.  However, if the
  4 19 violation causes a serious injury, a court could impose an
  4 20 additional fine of $2,000 and suspend the person's driver's
  4 21 license for not more than 180 days.  If the violation causes a
  4 22 death, a court could impose an additional fine of $10,000 and
  4 23 suspend the person's driver's license for not more than two
  4 24 years.
  4 25    The bill does not authorize a peace officer to confiscate
  4 26 a mobile telephone from an operator or occupant of a motor
  4 27 vehicle. However, a peace officer may stop or detain an
  4 28 operator solely for using a mobile telephone while operating a
  4 29 motor vehicle.

  3 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 14    This bill prohibits a person from operating a motor vehicle
  3 15 while using a mobile telephone unless the mobile telephone
  3 16 is specifically designed and configured to allow hands=free
  3 17 listening and talking and is used in that manner.  The bill
  3 18 does not apply to the operator of a motor vehicle when the
  3 19 motor vehicle is at a complete stop off the roadway.  In
  3 20 addition, the bill exempts the following persons from the
  3 21 prohibition:  a member of a public safety agency performing
  3 22 official duties; a health care professional in the course of
  3 23 an emergency situation; and a person receiving safety=related
  3 24 information including emergency, traffic, or weather alerts.
  3 25 These are the same exemptions that apply under current law for
  3 26 text=messaging while driving.
  3 27    The bill defines "mobile telephone" to mean the same
  3 28 as defined in federal motor carrier safety administration
  3 29 regulations.  Under that definition, "mobile telephone" means
  3 30 a mobile communication device that falls under or uses any
  3 31 commercial mobile radio service, as defined in regulations of
  3 32 the federal communications commission.  The federal definition
  3 33 explicitly excludes two=way or citizens band radio services.
  3 34    The bill amends current provisions prohibiting
  3 35 text=messaging while driving to specify that a person does not
  4  1 violate the text=messaging provisions by using a fixed unit
  4  2 global positioning system or navigation system, provided the
  4  3 person does not enter data into the system while operating
  4  4 the motor vehicle.  "Fixed unit global positioning system or
  4  5 navigation system" is defined as an electronic device mounted
  4  6 inside a motor vehicle and capable of providing navigation
  4  7 directions to a driver based on data entered into the device.
  4  8 The bill also strikes a current exception to the prohibition
  4  9 on text=messaging while driving which applies to a person
  4 10 selecting or entering a telephone number or name in a hand=held
  4 11 mobile telephone or activating, deactivating, or initiating a
  4 12 function of a hand=held mobile telephone.
  4 13    A person who uses a mobile telephone while operating a motor
  4 14 vehicle in violation of the bill commits a simple misdemeanor
  4 15 punishable by a scheduled fine of $100.  The offense is not
  4 16 a moving violation, and therefore cannot be considered for
  4 17 purposes of administrative suspension of a driver's license
  4 18 or to establish habitual offender status.  However, if the
  4 19 violation causes a serious injury, a court could impose an
  4 20 additional fine of $2,000 and suspend the person's driver's
  4 21 license for not more than 180 days.  If the violation causes a
  4 22 death, a court could impose an additional fine of $10,000 and
  4 23 suspend the person's driver's license for not more than two
  4 24 years.

  4 26 a mobile telephone from an operator or occupant of a motor
  4 27 vehicle. However, a peace officer may stop or detain an

  4 13    A person who uses a mobile telephone while operating a motor
  4 14 vehicle in violation of the bill commits a simple misdemeanor
  4 15 punishable by a scheduled fine of $100.  The offense is not
  4 16 a moving violation, and therefore cannot be considered for

  4 18 or to establish habitual offender status.  However, if the
  4 19 violation causes a serious injury, a court could impose an
  4 20 additional fine of $2,000 and suspend the person's driver's
  4 21 license for not more than 180 days.  If the violation causes a
  4 22 death, a court could impose an additional fine of $10,000 and
  4 23 suspend the person's driver's license for not more than two
  4 24 years.
