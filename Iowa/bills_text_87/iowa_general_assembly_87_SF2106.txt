  6 32 without a valid permit or in other enumerated circumstances.
  6 33 Instead, the bill section creates a new crime of going armed

  7 12 Code section with a provision stating that the availability
  7 13 of a professional or nonprofessional permit to carry weapons
  7 14 shall not be construed to impose a general prohibition on the
  7 15 unlicensed carrying of a deadly weapon including a loaded

  7 28 accordance with Code chapter 724 or the person must complete
  7 29 a satisfactory national instant criminal background check

  8  6    The bill provides a permit to acquire a pistol or revolver
  8  7 issued under Code chapter 724 (2018) prior to July 1, 2018,
  8  8 shall be considered a valid permit to acquire as long as the
  8  9 permit has not expired unless the person becomes ineligible to
  8 10 acquire a pistol or revolver.
  8 11    The bill, in Code section 724.15, provides that a permit to

  6 28 acquiring pistols and revolvers.
  6 29    DIVISION I ==== CARRYING AND POSSESSING WEAPONS WITHOUT A
  6 30 PERMIT.  The bill strikes Code section 724.4 relating to the
  6 31 crime of carrying dangerous weapons, an aggravated misdemeanor,
  6 32 without a valid permit or in other enumerated circumstances.
  6 33 Instead, the bill section creates a new crime of going armed
  6 34 with a knife in the commission of a crime, an aggravated
  6 35 misdemeanor.  The bill makes a conforming change to Code
  7  1 section 232.52, subsection 2, relating to the suspension or
  7  2 revocation of a juvenile's driver's license or operating
  7  3 privilege. The bill also makes conforming changes to Code
  7  4 section 724.4B, relating to the carrying of weapons on school

  7  7 that were previously identified by reference to Code section
  7  8 724.4, paragraphs "b" through "f" or "j".
  7  9    The bill strikes Code section 724.5 relating to a person's
  7 10 duty to carry a valid permit to carry certain weapons for
  7 11 which a permit has been issued to the person and replaces that
  7 12 Code section with a provision stating that the availability

  7 14 shall not be construed to impose a general prohibition on the
  7 15 unlicensed carrying of a deadly weapon including a loaded
  7 16 firearm.

  7 28 accordance with Code chapter 724 or the person must complete
  7 29 a satisfactory national instant criminal background check

  7 33 to acquire a pistol or revolver in this state.
  7 34    The bill also makes a conforming change to Code section

  6 28 acquiring pistols and revolvers.
  6 29    DIVISION I ==== CARRYING AND POSSESSING WEAPONS WITHOUT A
  6 30 PERMIT.  The bill strikes Code section 724.4 relating to the
  6 31 crime of carrying dangerous weapons, an aggravated misdemeanor,
  6 32 without a valid permit or in other enumerated circumstances.
  6 33 Instead, the bill section creates a new crime of going armed
  6 34 with a knife in the commission of a crime, an aggravated
  6 35 misdemeanor.  The bill makes a conforming change to Code
  7  1 section 232.52, subsection 2, relating to the suspension or

  7  5 grounds, by specifically identifying certain categories of
  7  6 persons who are authorized to carry weapons on school grounds
  7  7 that were previously identified by reference to Code section
  7  8 724.4, paragraphs "b" through "f" or "j".
  7  9    The bill strikes Code section 724.5 relating to a person's
  7 10 duty to carry a valid permit to carry certain weapons for
  7 11 which a permit has been issued to the person and replaces that
  7 12 Code section with a provision stating that the availability
  7 13 of a professional or nonprofessional permit to carry weapons
  7 14 shall not be construed to impose a general prohibition on the
  7 15 unlicensed carrying of a deadly weapon including a loaded
  7 16 firearm.

  7 28 accordance with Code chapter 724 or the person must complete
  7 29 a satisfactory national instant criminal background check
  7 30 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. {922(t). The bill provides that a valid
  7 31 permit to carry weapons or license issued by another state to
  7 32 any nonresident of this state does not satisfy the requirements
  7 33 to acquire a pistol or revolver in this state.
  7 34    The bill also makes a conforming change to Code section

  8 14 holder may file an appeal with an administrative law judge
  8 15 under Code section 724.21A as written in the 2018 Code.
  8 16    By striking the requirement to obtain a permit to acquire a
  8 17 pistol or revolver, and moving certain requirements to acquire
  8 18 a pistol or revolver into Code section 724.15 as amended in the
  8 19 bill, the bill repeals Code sections 724.17 (application for
