  3  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  5    This bill requires the board of directors of each public
  3  6 school district to have a short=term test for radon gas
  3  7 performed at each attendance center under its control at
  3  8 least once by June 30, 2028, and at least once every 10 years
  3  9 thereafter, and following new construction of an attendance
  3 10 center or additions, renovations, or repairs to an attendance
  3 11 center. If the results of such a test are at or above four
  3 12 picocuries per liter, the bill requires the board to have a
  3 13 second short=term test performed at the attendance center
  3 14 within 90 days.
  3 15    If the results of a second test are at or above four
  3 16 picocuries per liter, the bill requires the board of directors
  3 17 of the public school district to retain a person credentialed
  3 18 to perform radon abatement measures to develop a radon
  3 19 mitigation plan within 90 days. The radon mitigation plan must
  3 20 be implemented within one year.
  3 21    If the results of a short=term test at an attendance center
  3 22 at which a radon mitigation plan has been implemented are at or
  3 23 above four picocuries per liter, the bill requires the board
  3 24 of directors of the public school district to retain a person
  3 25 credentialed to perform radon abatement measures to develop
  3 26 an alternative radon mitigation plan within 90 days. The
  3 27 alternative radon mitigation plan must be implemented within
  3 28 one year.
  3 29    The bill requires biennial, short=term radon testing for any
  3 30 school site at which a radon mitigation plan or an alternative
  3 31 radon mitigation plan has been implemented, which continues
  3 32 until the results have been less than four picocuries per liter
  3 33 for four consecutive years.
  3 34    The bill defines "short=term test" as a test approved by the
  3 35 department of public health in which a testing device remains
  4  1 in an area for not less than two days and not more than 90 days
  4  2 to determine the amount of radon in the air.  Radon testing
  4  3 pursuant to the bill must be conducted by a person certified
  4  4 to conduct such testing and must be conducted as prescribed by
  4  5 the department of public health.  Radon mitigation plans and
  4  6 alternative radon mitigation plans pursuant to the bill must

  4 12 in schools.
  4 13    The bill adds radon testing and radon mitigation pursuant to
  4 14 the bill to the list of permissible uses of a physical plant
  4 15 and equipment levy by a school district.
  4 16    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  4 17 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
  4 18 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
  4 19 district from state school foundation aid received by the
  4 20 school district under Code section 257.16.  The specification
  4 21 is deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate

  3  9 thereafter, and following new construction of an attendance

  3 11 center. If the results of such a test are at or above four
  3 12 picocuries per liter, the bill requires the board to have a
  3 13 second short=term test performed at the attendance center
  3 14 within 90 days.
  3 15    If the results of a second test are at or above four

  3 17 of the public school district to retain a person credentialed
  3 18 to perform radon abatement measures to develop a radon
  3 19 mitigation plan within 90 days. The radon mitigation plan must
  3 20 be implemented within one year.
  3 21    If the results of a short=term test at an attendance center
  3 22 at which a radon mitigation plan has been implemented are at or

  3 24 of directors of the public school district to retain a person
  3 25 credentialed to perform radon abatement measures to develop
  3 26 an alternative radon mitigation plan within 90 days. The
  3 27 alternative radon mitigation plan must be implemented within
  3 28 one year.
  3 29    The bill requires biennial, short=term radon testing for any
  3 30 school site at which a radon mitigation plan or an alternative
  3 31 radon mitigation plan has been implemented, which continues
  3 32 until the results have been less than four picocuries per liter
  3 33 for four consecutive years.
  3 34    The bill defines "short=term test" as a test approved by the
  3 35 department of public health in which a testing device remains
  4  1 in an area for not less than two days and not more than 90 days
  4  2 to determine the amount of radon in the air.  Radon testing
  4  3 pursuant to the bill must be conducted by a person certified
  4  4 to conduct such testing and must be conducted as prescribed by
