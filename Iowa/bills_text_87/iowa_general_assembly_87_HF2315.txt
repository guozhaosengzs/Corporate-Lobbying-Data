  7 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 27    GENERAL.  This bill amends provisions in Code chapter
  7 28 351 which provide for the prevention of rabies in dogs by a
  7 29 licensed veterinarian (veterinarian) and the confiscation,
  7 30 impoundment, and disposition of certain animals, including
  7 31 dogs, by a local board of health or law enforcement official
  7 32 (local authority) in part according to rules adopted by the
  7 33 department of agriculture and land stewardship (department).
  7 34    DOGS AS PROPERTY.  The bill provides that a dog is considered
  7 35 property according to several forms of proof of ownership,
  8  1 including a rabies prevention credential as described in the
  8  2 bill, a tattoo on the dog's skin, a device implanted under the
  8  3 dog's skin, or a DNA profile on record.  Under current law, the
  8  4 dog's status as property is determined by its age and whether
  8  5 it is wearing a collar attached with a rabies vaccination tag
  8  6 (Code section 351.25).
  8  7    RIGHT TO KILL DOG.  The bill provides that a person may kill
  8  8 a dog regardless of whether it is wearing a collar with an
  8  9 attached rabies tag, if the dog is endangering an individual
  8 10 or domestic animal or fowl.  The provision does not apply to
  8 11 a police service dog; a dog protecting the property, life,
  8 12 or safety of the dog's owner or immediate family; or the dog
  8 13 is engaged in or being trained to be engaged in performing a
  8 14 lawful task.  Under current law, a person has a right to kill
  8 15 a dog not wearing such collar (Code section 351.26); or a dog
  8 16 wearing the collar if it is harassing a domestic animal or
  8 17 fowl or attacking or attempting to bite a person (Code section
  8 18 351.27).
  8 19    RABIES PREVENTION.  The bill requires the owner of a dog
  8 20 to obtain evidence (credentials) that the dog is prevented
  8 21 from contracting the rabies virus.  This includes a rabies
  8 22 vaccination certificate and rabies vaccination tag to be
  8 23 worn on the dog's collar.  Otherwise, the credentials are a
  8 24 rabies antibody titer test certificate and a rabies antibody
  8 25 titer test tag that also must be worn on the dog's collar.
  8 26 Under current law, a dog that is over six months old must be
  8 27 vaccinated and revaccinated according to rules adopted by the
  8 28 department (Code sections 351.33 and 351.35).
  8 29    CONFISCATION, IMPOUNDMENT, AND DISPOSITION.  The bill
  8 30 provides that a dog's owner may redeem a dog confiscated and
  8 31 impounded by a local authority if the owner furnishes rabies
  8 32 prevention credentials.  The local authority must arrange for
  8 33 the disposition of an unredeemed dog by sale, transfer, or
  8 34 relinquishment of title to an animal shelter.  If an animal has
  8 35 been confiscated based on a suspected rabies infection, the
  9  1 local authority must test the animal.  An uninfected dog must
  9  2 be returned its owner.  Under current law, a local authority
  9  3 must confiscate a dog and either return it to its owner or
  9  4 humanely destroy it after 10 days (Code section 351.39).
  9  5    COURT ORDER.  The bill prohibits a local authority from
  9  6 confiscating, impounding, or disposing of a dog that is
  9  7 considered property without obtaining a court order.  The dog
  9  8 cannot be placed in the custody of a private person, cannot be
  9  9 sterilized, and must be provided with an adequate standard of
  9 10 care.
  9 11    CRIMINAL OFFENSE == FALSE REPORT.  The bill creates a
  9 12 new criminal offense referred to as "false report" which
  9 13 is committed by a person providing incorrect or incomplete
  9 14 information to a local board of health or law enforcement
  9 15 official, knowing that the information will likely result in
  9 16 the confiscation of a dog that is property.  A person who
  9 17 commits the offense is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.  The
  9 18 person may also be ordered to pay for costs associated with the
  9 19 prosecution.
  9 20    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTY.  A person who is in violation
  9 21 of a provision in the Code chapter is guilty of a simple
  9 22 misdemeanor (Code section 351.43).  A simple misdemeanor is
  9 23 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of
  9 24 at least $65 but not more than $625 or by both.

  7 24                           EXPLANATION
  7 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 27    GENERAL.  This bill amends provisions in Code chapter
  7 28 351 which provide for the prevention of rabies in dogs by a
  7 29 licensed veterinarian (veterinarian) and the confiscation,
  7 30 impoundment, and disposition of certain animals, including
  7 31 dogs, by a local board of health or law enforcement official
  7 32 (local authority) in part according to rules adopted by the
  7 33 department of agriculture and land stewardship (department).
  7 34    DOGS AS PROPERTY.  The bill provides that a dog is considered
  7 35 property according to several forms of proof of ownership,
  8  1 including a rabies prevention credential as described in the
  8  2 bill, a tattoo on the dog's skin, a device implanted under the
  8  3 dog's skin, or a DNA profile on record.  Under current law, the
  8  4 dog's status as property is determined by its age and whether
  8  5 it is wearing a collar attached with a rabies vaccination tag
  8  6 (Code section 351.25).
  8  7    RIGHT TO KILL DOG.  The bill provides that a person may kill
  8  8 a dog regardless of whether it is wearing a collar with an
  8  9 attached rabies tag, if the dog is endangering an individual
  8 10 or domestic animal or fowl.  The provision does not apply to
  8 11 a police service dog; a dog protecting the property, life,
  8 12 or safety of the dog's owner or immediate family; or the dog
  8 13 is engaged in or being trained to be engaged in performing a
  8 14 lawful task.  Under current law, a person has a right to kill
  8 15 a dog not wearing such collar (Code section 351.26); or a dog
  8 16 wearing the collar if it is harassing a domestic animal or
  8 17 fowl or attacking or attempting to bite a person (Code section
  8 18 351.27).
  8 19    RABIES PREVENTION.  The bill requires the owner of a dog
  8 20 to obtain evidence (credentials) that the dog is prevented
  8 21 from contracting the rabies virus.  This includes a rabies
  8 22 vaccination certificate and rabies vaccination tag to be
  8 23 worn on the dog's collar.  Otherwise, the credentials are a
  8 24 rabies antibody titer test certificate and a rabies antibody
  8 25 titer test tag that also must be worn on the dog's collar.
  8 26 Under current law, a dog that is over six months old must be
  8 27 vaccinated and revaccinated according to rules adopted by the
  8 28 department (Code sections 351.33 and 351.35).
  8 29    CONFISCATION, IMPOUNDMENT, AND DISPOSITION.  The bill
  8 30 provides that a dog's owner may redeem a dog confiscated and
  8 31 impounded by a local authority if the owner furnishes rabies
  8 32 prevention credentials.  The local authority must arrange for
  8 33 the disposition of an unredeemed dog by sale, transfer, or
  8 34 relinquishment of title to an animal shelter.  If an animal has
  8 35 been confiscated based on a suspected rabies infection, the
  9  1 local authority must test the animal.  An uninfected dog must
  9  2 be returned its owner.  Under current law, a local authority
  9  3 must confiscate a dog and either return it to its owner or
  9  4 humanely destroy it after 10 days (Code section 351.39).
  9  5    COURT ORDER.  The bill prohibits a local authority from
  9  6 confiscating, impounding, or disposing of a dog that is
  9  7 considered property without obtaining a court order.  The dog
  9  8 cannot be placed in the custody of a private person, cannot be
  9  9 sterilized, and must be provided with an adequate standard of
  9 10 care.
  9 11    CRIMINAL OFFENSE == FALSE REPORT.  The bill creates a
  9 12 new criminal offense referred to as "false report" which
  9 13 is committed by a person providing incorrect or incomplete
  9 14 information to a local board of health or law enforcement
  9 15 official, knowing that the information will likely result in
  9 16 the confiscation of a dog that is property.  A person who
  9 17 commits the offense is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.  The
  9 18 person may also be ordered to pay for costs associated with the
  9 19 prosecution.
  9 20    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTY.  A person who is in violation
  9 21 of a provision in the Code chapter is guilty of a simple
  9 22 misdemeanor (Code section 351.43).  A simple misdemeanor is
  9 23 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of
  9 24 at least $65 but not more than $625 or by both.

  7 15 of providing such information will likely result in the
  7 16 confiscation of a dog that is property under this chapter.
  7 17    2.  A person who commits the offense of filing a false
  7 18 report is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.  A person convicted
  7 19 of the offense is subject to paying for costs associated with
  7 20 impounding the dog.  A county or city that has the duty to
  7 21 prosecute the offense may recover costs of the prosecution from
  7 22 a defendant who has been convicted of the offense.

  7 34    DOGS AS PROPERTY.  The bill provides that a dog is considered
  7 35 property according to several forms of proof of ownership,
  8  1 including a rabies prevention credential as described in the
  8  2 bill, a tattoo on the dog's skin, a device implanted under the

  8 22 vaccination certificate and rabies vaccination tag to be
  8 23 worn on the dog's collar.  Otherwise, the credentials are a

  8 29    CONFISCATION, IMPOUNDMENT, AND DISPOSITION.  The bill
  8 30 provides that a dog's owner may redeem a dog confiscated and
  8 31 impounded by a local authority if the owner furnishes rabies
  8 32 prevention credentials.  The local authority must arrange for
  8 33 the disposition of an unredeemed dog by sale, transfer, or
  8 34 relinquishment of title to an animal shelter.  If an animal has
  8 35 been confiscated based on a suspected rabies infection, the

  9  5    COURT ORDER.  The bill prohibits a local authority from
  9  6 confiscating, impounding, or disposing of a dog that is
  9  7 considered property without obtaining a court order.  The dog
  9  8 cannot be placed in the custody of a private person, cannot be
  9  9 sterilized, and must be provided with an adequate standard of
  9 10 care.
  9 11    CRIMINAL OFFENSE == FALSE REPORT.  The bill creates a
  9 12 new criminal offense referred to as "false report" which
  9 13 is committed by a person providing incorrect or incomplete
  9 14 information to a local board of health or law enforcement
  9 15 official, knowing that the information will likely result in
  9 16 the confiscation of a dog that is property.  A person who
  9 17 commits the offense is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.  The
  9 18 person may also be ordered to pay for costs associated with the
  9 19 prosecution.

  7 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 27    GENERAL.  This bill amends provisions in Code chapter
  7 28 351 which provide for the prevention of rabies in dogs by a
  7 29 licensed veterinarian (veterinarian) and the confiscation,
  7 30 impoundment, and disposition of certain animals, including
  7 31 dogs, by a local board of health or law enforcement official
  7 32 (local authority) in part according to rules adopted by the
  7 33 department of agriculture and land stewardship (department).
  7 34    DOGS AS PROPERTY.  The bill provides that a dog is considered
  7 35 property according to several forms of proof of ownership,
  8  1 including a rabies prevention credential as described in the
  8  2 bill, a tattoo on the dog's skin, a device implanted under the
  8  3 dog's skin, or a DNA profile on record.  Under current law, the
  8  4 dog's status as property is determined by its age and whether
  8  5 it is wearing a collar attached with a rabies vaccination tag
  8  6 (Code section 351.25).
  8  7    RIGHT TO KILL DOG.  The bill provides that a person may kill
  8  8 a dog regardless of whether it is wearing a collar with an
  8  9 attached rabies tag, if the dog is endangering an individual
  8 10 or domestic animal or fowl.  The provision does not apply to
  8 11 a police service dog; a dog protecting the property, life,
  8 12 or safety of the dog's owner or immediate family; or the dog
  8 13 is engaged in or being trained to be engaged in performing a
  8 14 lawful task.  Under current law, a person has a right to kill
  8 15 a dog not wearing such collar (Code section 351.26); or a dog
  8 16 wearing the collar if it is harassing a domestic animal or
  8 17 fowl or attacking or attempting to bite a person (Code section
  8 18 351.27).
  8 19    RABIES PREVENTION.  The bill requires the owner of a dog
  8 20 to obtain evidence (credentials) that the dog is prevented
  8 21 from contracting the rabies virus.  This includes a rabies
  8 22 vaccination certificate and rabies vaccination tag to be
  8 23 worn on the dog's collar.  Otherwise, the credentials are a
  8 24 rabies antibody titer test certificate and a rabies antibody
  8 25 titer test tag that also must be worn on the dog's collar.
  8 26 Under current law, a dog that is over six months old must be
  8 27 vaccinated and revaccinated according to rules adopted by the
  8 28 department (Code sections 351.33 and 351.35).
  8 29    CONFISCATION, IMPOUNDMENT, AND DISPOSITION.  The bill
  8 30 provides that a dog's owner may redeem a dog confiscated and
  8 31 impounded by a local authority if the owner furnishes rabies
  8 32 prevention credentials.  The local authority must arrange for
  8 33 the disposition of an unredeemed dog by sale, transfer, or
  8 34 relinquishment of title to an animal shelter.  If an animal has
  8 35 been confiscated based on a suspected rabies infection, the
  9  1 local authority must test the animal.  An uninfected dog must
  9  2 be returned its owner.  Under current law, a local authority
  9  3 must confiscate a dog and either return it to its owner or
  9  4 humanely destroy it after 10 days (Code section 351.39).
  9  5    COURT ORDER.  The bill prohibits a local authority from
  9  6 confiscating, impounding, or disposing of a dog that is
  9  7 considered property without obtaining a court order.  The dog
  9  8 cannot be placed in the custody of a private person, cannot be
  9  9 sterilized, and must be provided with an adequate standard of
  9 10 care.
  9 11    CRIMINAL OFFENSE == FALSE REPORT.  The bill creates a
  9 12 new criminal offense referred to as "false report" which
  9 13 is committed by a person providing incorrect or incomplete
  9 14 information to a local board of health or law enforcement
  9 15 official, knowing that the information will likely result in
  9 16 the confiscation of a dog that is property.  A person who
  9 17 commits the offense is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.  The
  9 18 person may also be ordered to pay for costs associated with the
  9 19 prosecution.
  9 20    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTY.  A person who is in violation
  9 21 of a provision in the Code chapter is guilty of a simple
  9 22 misdemeanor (Code section 351.43).  A simple misdemeanor is
  9 23 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of
  9 24 at least $65 but not more than $625 or by both.

  7 28 351 which provide for the prevention of rabies in dogs by a
  7 29 licensed veterinarian (veterinarian) and the confiscation,
  7 30 impoundment, and disposition of certain animals, including
  7 31 dogs, by a local board of health or law enforcement official
  7 32 (local authority) in part according to rules adopted by the
  7 33 department of agriculture and land stewardship (department).
  7 34    DOGS AS PROPERTY.  The bill provides that a dog is considered
  7 35 property according to several forms of proof of ownership,
  8  1 including a rabies prevention credential as described in the
  8  2 bill, a tattoo on the dog's skin, a device implanted under the
  8  3 dog's skin, or a DNA profile on record.  Under current law, the
  8  4 dog's status as property is determined by its age and whether
  8  5 it is wearing a collar attached with a rabies vaccination tag
  8  6 (Code section 351.25).
  8  7    RIGHT TO KILL DOG.  The bill provides that a person may kill
  8  8 a dog regardless of whether it is wearing a collar with an
  8  9 attached rabies tag, if the dog is endangering an individual
  8 10 or domestic animal or fowl.  The provision does not apply to
  8 11 a police service dog; a dog protecting the property, life,
  8 12 or safety of the dog's owner or immediate family; or the dog
  8 13 is engaged in or being trained to be engaged in performing a
  8 14 lawful task.  Under current law, a person has a right to kill
  8 15 a dog not wearing such collar (Code section 351.26); or a dog
  8 16 wearing the collar if it is harassing a domestic animal or
  8 17 fowl or attacking or attempting to bite a person (Code section
  8 18 351.27).
  8 19    RABIES PREVENTION.  The bill requires the owner of a dog
  8 20 to obtain evidence (credentials) that the dog is prevented
  8 21 from contracting the rabies virus.  This includes a rabies
  8 22 vaccination certificate and rabies vaccination tag to be
  8 23 worn on the dog's collar.  Otherwise, the credentials are a
  8 24 rabies antibody titer test certificate and a rabies antibody
  8 25 titer test tag that also must be worn on the dog's collar.
  8 26 Under current law, a dog that is over six months old must be
  8 27 vaccinated and revaccinated according to rules adopted by the
  8 28 department (Code sections 351.33 and 351.35).
  8 29    CONFISCATION, IMPOUNDMENT, AND DISPOSITION.  The bill
  8 30 provides that a dog's owner may redeem a dog confiscated and
  8 31 impounded by a local authority if the owner furnishes rabies
  8 32 prevention credentials.  The local authority must arrange for
  8 33 the disposition of an unredeemed dog by sale, transfer, or
  8 34 relinquishment of title to an animal shelter.  If an animal has
  8 35 been confiscated based on a suspected rabies infection, the
  9  1 local authority must test the animal.  An uninfected dog must
  9  2 be returned its owner.  Under current law, a local authority
  9  3 must confiscate a dog and either return it to its owner or
  9  4 humanely destroy it after 10 days (Code section 351.39).
  9  5    COURT ORDER.  The bill prohibits a local authority from
  9  6 confiscating, impounding, or disposing of a dog that is
  9  7 considered property without obtaining a court order.  The dog
  9  8 cannot be placed in the custody of a private person, cannot be
  9  9 sterilized, and must be provided with an adequate standard of
  9 10 care.
  9 11    CRIMINAL OFFENSE == FALSE REPORT.  The bill creates a
  9 12 new criminal offense referred to as "false report" which
  9 13 is committed by a person providing incorrect or incomplete
  9 14 information to a local board of health or law enforcement
  9 15 official, knowing that the information will likely result in
  9 16 the confiscation of a dog that is property.  A person who
  9 17 commits the offense is guilty of a simple misdemeanor.  The
  9 18 person may also be ordered to pay for costs associated with the
  9 19 prosecution.
  9 20    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTY.  A person who is in violation
  9 21 of a provision in the Code chapter is guilty of a simple
  9 22 misdemeanor (Code section 351.43).  A simple misdemeanor is
  9 23 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of
  9 24 at least $65 but not more than $625 or by both.
