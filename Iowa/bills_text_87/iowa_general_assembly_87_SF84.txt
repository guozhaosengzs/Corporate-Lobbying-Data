  2 12                           EXPLANATION
  2 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 15    Under current law, the use of headlamps is required from
  2 16 sunset to sunrise and at all other times when conditions such
  2 17 as fog, snow, sleet, or rain provide insufficient lighting to
  2 18 clearly see 500 feet ahead. This bill amends Code section
  2 19 321.384 to require the operator of a motor vehicle to display
  2 20 lighted headlamps from sunset to sunrise, whenever atmospheric
  2 21 conditions require the use of windshield wipers, during any
  2 22 period of rain, drizzle, sleet, hail, snow, blowing snow,
  2 23 freezing rain, or ground=level fog, or whenever, due to
  2 24 insufficient lighting or unfavorable atmospheric conditions,
  2 25 persons and vehicles on the highway are not clearly discernible
  2 26 at a distance of 1,000 feet.
  2 27    The penalty for a violation of Code section 321.384 remains a
  2 28 simple misdemeanor, punishable by a scheduled fine of $30. The
  2 29 bill adds a violation of Code section 321.384 to the list of
  2 30 traffic offenses for which additional penalties may be imposed
  2 31 for a violation causing serious injury to or death of another
  2 32 person.  If the violation causes a serious injury, a court
  2 33 could impose an additional fine of $500 or suspend the person's
  2 34 driver's license for not more than 90 days, or both.  If the
  2 35 violation causes a death, a court could impose an additional
  3  1 fine of $1,000 or suspend the person's driver's license for not
  3  2 more than 180 days, or both.
  3  3    The following Code sections contain provisions which are
  3  4 linked to the times when headlamps are required under Code
  3  5 section 321.384 and are therefore affected indirectly by the
  3  6 bill:
  3  7    Code section 321.235A, which requires the use of a headlight
  3  8 and a rear reflector on electric personal assistive mobility
  3  9 devices.
  3 10    Code section 321.392, which requires the use of certain
  3 11 lighting devices and reflectors on motor trucks.
  3 12    Code section 321.394, which requires a red light to be
  3 13 displayed on projecting loads.
  3 14    Code section 321.395, which requires lighting on vehicles
  3 15 stopped on an unlighted roadway or shoulder.
  3 16    Code sections 321.397, 321.398, and 321.418, which describe
  3 17 lighting requirements for bicycles, animal drawn vehicles, and
  3 18 slow=moving vehicles.
  3 19    Code section 321.405, which requires self=illumination of
  3 20 mechanical signal devices.
  3 21    Code sections 321.415 and 321.419, which provide

  2 12                           EXPLANATION
  2 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 15    Under current law, the use of headlamps is required from
  2 16 sunset to sunrise and at all other times when conditions such
  2 17 as fog, snow, sleet, or rain provide insufficient lighting to
  2 18 clearly see 500 feet ahead. This bill amends Code section
  2 19 321.384 to require the operator of a motor vehicle to display
  2 20 lighted headlamps from sunset to sunrise, whenever atmospheric
  2 21 conditions require the use of windshield wipers, during any
  2 22 period of rain, drizzle, sleet, hail, snow, blowing snow,
  2 23 freezing rain, or ground=level fog, or whenever, due to
  2 24 insufficient lighting or unfavorable atmospheric conditions,
  2 25 persons and vehicles on the highway are not clearly discernible
  2 26 at a distance of 1,000 feet.
  2 27    The penalty for a violation of Code section 321.384 remains a
  2 28 simple misdemeanor, punishable by a scheduled fine of $30. The
  2 29 bill adds a violation of Code section 321.384 to the list of
  2 30 traffic offenses for which additional penalties may be imposed
  2 31 for a violation causing serious injury to or death of another
  2 32 person.  If the violation causes a serious injury, a court
  2 33 could impose an additional fine of $500 or suspend the person's
  2 34 driver's license for not more than 90 days, or both.  If the
  2 35 violation causes a death, a court could impose an additional
  3  1 fine of $1,000 or suspend the person's driver's license for not
  3  2 more than 180 days, or both.
  3  3    The following Code sections contain provisions which are
  3  4 linked to the times when headlamps are required under Code
  3  5 section 321.384 and are therefore affected indirectly by the
  3  6 bill:
