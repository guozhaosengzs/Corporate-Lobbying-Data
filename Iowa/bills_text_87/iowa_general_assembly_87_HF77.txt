  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body
  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested
  4 12 recording.
  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a

  4 32 of if such a reason exists.

  5  1 to have committed a violation of this section. For a first
  5  2 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.

  5  7 agency is unable to produce a body camera recording required

  5 12 civil action.
  5 13    9.  An agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the

  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4 30 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  4 31 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  4 32 of if such a reason exists.
  4 33    7.  A peace officer who fails to record any interaction as

  5  6    8.  If during a criminal prosecution or civil action an
  5  7 agency is unable to produce a body camera recording required
  5  8 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  5  9 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the

  5 11 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5 12 civil action.
  5 13    9.  An agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  2 14 would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  2 15    a.  If a peace officer wearing a body camera enters a
  2 16 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  2 17 exist, the peace officer shall immediately ask whether a
  2 18 resident desires the peace officer to stop the body camera

  3 17 retain the contents of the recording under paragraph "a" or "b"
  3 18 shall be extended to equal the time period for the retention of

  3 20    d.  An agency shall post on the public internet site of the
  3 21 agency its policies relating to the retention of recordings

  4  3 to disclose the contents of the recording to the other person.
  4  4    (2)  Such person making such a request is not required to
  4  5 file a complaint and the contents of the recording are not
  4  6 required to be part of an investigation in order for a person
  4  7 to make such a request.
  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body
  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested
  4 12 recording.
  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a
  4 14 recording created by a body camera, may request a copy of such

  4 29 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  4 30 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The

  4 32 of if such a reason exists.

  5  1 to have committed a violation of this section. For a first
  5  2 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  5  3 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  5  4 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the

  5  6    8.  If during a criminal prosecution or civil action an
  5  7 agency is unable to produce a body camera recording required
  5  8 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  5  9 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the

  5 12 civil action.
  5 13    9.  An agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a

  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4 30 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  4 31 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  4 32 of if such a reason exists.
  4 33    7.  A peace officer who fails to record any interaction as
  4 34 required by this section or who fails to stop recording an
  4 35 interaction as required by this section shall be considered
  5  1 to have committed a violation of this section. For a first
  5  2 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  5  3 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  5  4 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the
  5  5 violation has been completed.
  5  6    8.  If during a criminal prosecution or civil action an
  5  7 agency is unable to produce a body camera recording required
  5  8 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  5  9 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the
  5 10 version of the facts advanced by the defendant in the criminal
  5 11 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5 12 civil action.
  5 13    9.  An agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 17 3, shall not apply to this Act.
  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  2 27 of a crime, the peace officer shall immediately ask whether
  2 28 the person desires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  2 29 recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in the
  2 30 affirmative, the peace officer shall stop the body camera
  2 31 recording.  The peace officer shall record the question

  3 16 evidence in the criminal prosecution and the time period to
  3 17 retain the contents of the recording under paragraph "a" or "b"
  3 18 shall be extended to equal the time period for the retention of
  3 19 other evidence that may be use in the criminal prosecution.
  3 20    d.  An agency shall post on the public internet site of the
  3 21 agency its policies relating to the retention of recordings

  4  3 to disclose the contents of the recording to the other person.
  4  4    (2)  Such person making such a request is not required to
  4  5 file a complaint and the contents of the recording are not
  4  6 required to be part of an investigation in order for a person
  4  7 to make such a request.
  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body
  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested
  4 12 recording.
  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a
  4 14 recording created by a body camera, may request a copy of such
  4 15 recording.  Before the request is granted, each person who is
  4 16 part of the contents of the recording shall be notified of
  4 17 the request and may object to the request.  If no objection
  4 18 is made, the agency shall make available to the requesting
  4 19 party a copy of the contents of the recording. If an objection

  4 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  4 29 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  4 30 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  4 31 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  4 32 of if such a reason exists.

  4 34 required by this section or who fails to stop recording an
  4 35 interaction as required by this section shall be considered
  5  1 to have committed a violation of this section. For a first
  5  2 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  5  3 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  5  4 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the
  5  5 violation has been completed.
  5  6    8.  If during a criminal prosecution or civil action an
  5  7 agency is unable to produce a body camera recording required
  5  8 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  5  9 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the
  5 10 version of the facts advanced by the defendant in the criminal
  5 11 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5 12 civil action.
  5 13    9.  An agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  2 27 of a crime, the peace officer shall immediately ask whether
  2 28 the person desires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  2 29 recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in the

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a

  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  2 19 recording while the peace officer is in the residence. If the

  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  2 30 affirmative, the peace officer shall stop the body camera
  2 31 recording.  The peace officer shall record the question
  2 32 required to be asked by this paragraph and any answer to the
  2 33 question.

  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body
  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested
  4 12 recording.
  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  3 30 relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  3 31 related to the recording.
  3 32    (c)  A parent or legal guardian of a person described in
  3 33 subparagraph division (a) or (b).
  3 34    (d)  An attorney for a person described in subparagraph
  3 35 division (a) or (b).
  4  1    (e)  Any other person if the person described in subparagraph
  4  2 division (a) or (b) has given written authority to the agency
  4  3 to disclose the contents of the recording to the other person.
  4  4    (2)  Such person making such a request is not required to
  4  5 file a complaint and the contents of the recording are not
  4  6 required to be part of an investigation in order for a person
  4  7 to make such a request.
  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body
  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested
  4 12 recording.
  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a
  4 14 recording created by a body camera, may request a copy of such
  4 15 recording.  Before the request is granted, each person who is
  4 16 part of the contents of the recording shall be notified of
  4 17 the request and may object to the request.  If no objection
  4 18 is made, the agency shall make available to the requesting
  4 19 party a copy of the contents of the recording. If an objection
  4 20 is made, the objecting party has thirty days to petition the

  4 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  4 29 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  4 30 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  4 31 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  4 32 of if such a reason exists.

  4 34 required by this section or who fails to stop recording an
  4 35 interaction as required by this section shall be considered
  5  1 to have committed a violation of this section. For a first
  5  2 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  5  3 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  5  4 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the
  5  5 violation has been completed.

  5  7 agency is unable to produce a body camera recording required
  5  8 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable

  5 10 version of the facts advanced by the defendant in the criminal
  5 11 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5 12 civil action.
  5 13    9.  An agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  2 19 recording while the peace officer is in the residence. If the

  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body

  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,

  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a

  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body

  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body

  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff

  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.

  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing

  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record

  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of

  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a

  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4  7 to make such a request.
  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body
  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested
  4 12 recording.
  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a
  4 14 recording created by a body camera, may request a copy of such
  4 15 recording.  Before the request is granted, each person who is
  4 16 part of the contents of the recording shall be notified of
  4 17 the request and may object to the request.  If no objection
  4 18 is made, the agency shall make available to the requesting
  4 19 party a copy of the contents of the recording. If an objection
  4 20 is made, the objecting party has thirty days to petition the
  4 21 district court to order that the contents of the recording not
  4 22 be released, otherwise the contents of the recording shall be
  4 23 released.
  4 24    g.  Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a
  4 25 recording created by a body camera, the person who has the
  4 26 responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording on
  4 27 behalf of the agency, shall review all applicable and available
  4 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  4 29 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  4 30 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  4 31 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  4 32 of if such a reason exists.
  4 33    7.  A peace officer who fails to record any interaction as
  4 34 required by this section or who fails to stop recording an
  4 35 interaction as required by this section shall be considered
  5  1 to have committed a violation of this section. For a first
  5  2 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  5  3 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  5  4 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the
  5  5 violation has been completed.
  5  6    8.  If during a criminal prosecution or civil action an
  5  7 agency is unable to produce a body camera recording required
  5  8 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  5  9 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the
  5 10 version of the facts advanced by the defendant in the criminal
  5 11 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5 12 civil action.
  5 13    9.  An agency shall participate in any existing state or
  5 14 federal programs that fund or supplement the costs to purchase
  5 15 and maintain body cameras worn by peace officers.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  2 28 the person desires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  2 29 recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in the
  2 30 affirmative, the peace officer shall stop the body camera

  4  3 to disclose the contents of the recording to the other person.
  4  4    (2)  Such person making such a request is not required to
  4  5 file a complaint and the contents of the recording are not
  4  6 required to be part of an investigation in order for a person
  4  7 to make such a request.
  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body
  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested
  4 12 recording.
  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a
  4 14 recording created by a body camera, may request a copy of such
  4 15 recording.  Before the request is granted, each person who is

  4 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  4 29 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  4 30 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  4 31 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  4 32 of if such a reason exists.

  5  1 to have committed a violation of this section. For a first
  5  2 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  5  3 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  5  4 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the
  5  5 violation has been completed.
  5  6    8.  If during a criminal prosecution or civil action an
  5  7 agency is unable to produce a body camera recording required
  5  8 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  5  9 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the

  5 11 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5 12 civil action.
  5 13    9.  An agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff

  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a

  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal

  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a

  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to

  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to

  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a

  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,

  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a

  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of

  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the

  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 12 civil action.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4  6 required to be part of an investigation in order for a person
  4  7 to make such a request.
  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body
  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested
  4 12 recording.
  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a
  4 14 recording created by a body camera, may request a copy of such
  4 15 recording.  Before the request is granted, each person who is
  4 16 part of the contents of the recording shall be notified of
  4 17 the request and may object to the request.  If no objection
  4 18 is made, the agency shall make available to the requesting
  4 19 party a copy of the contents of the recording. If an objection
  4 20 is made, the objecting party has thirty days to petition the

  4 22 be released, otherwise the contents of the recording shall be
  4 23 released.
  4 24    g.  Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a

  4 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  4 29 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  4 30 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  4 31 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  4 32 of if such a reason exists.
  4 33    7.  A peace officer who fails to record any interaction as
  4 34 required by this section or who fails to stop recording an
  4 35 interaction as required by this section shall be considered
  5  1 to have committed a violation of this section. For a first
  5  2 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  5  3 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  5  4 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the
  5  5 violation has been completed.
  5  6    8.  If during a criminal prosecution or civil action an
  5  7 agency is unable to produce a body camera recording required
  5  8 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  5  9 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the
  5 10 version of the facts advanced by the defendant in the criminal
  5 11 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5 12 civil action.
  5 13    9.  An agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  3 20    d.  An agency shall post on the public internet site of the
  3 21 agency its policies relating to the retention of recordings
  3 22 created by body cameras, requests for the retention of the
  3 23 recordings, and requests for copies of such recordings.
  3 24    e.  (1)  Any of the following persons may make a request
  3 25 that the contents of a recording created by a body camera be
  3 26 retained by the agency for the period of time set out under
  3 27 paragraph "b":
  3 28    (a)  A person who is part of the contents of the recording.
  3 29    (b)  A person whose property has been seized or damaged in
  3 30 relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime that is
  3 31 related to the recording.
  3 32    (c)  A parent or legal guardian of a person described in
  3 33 subparagraph division (a) or (b).
  3 34    (d)  An attorney for a person described in subparagraph
  3 35 division (a) or (b).
  4  1    (e)  Any other person if the person described in subparagraph
  4  2 division (a) or (b) has given written authority to the agency
  4  3 to disclose the contents of the recording to the other person.
  4  4    (2)  Such person making such a request is not required to
  4  5 file a complaint and the contents of the recording are not
  4  6 required to be part of an investigation in order for a person
  4  7 to make such a request.
  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body
  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested
  4 12 recording.
  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a
  4 14 recording created by a body camera, may request a copy of such
  4 15 recording.  Before the request is granted, each person who is
  4 16 part of the contents of the recording shall be notified of
  4 17 the request and may object to the request.  If no objection
  4 18 is made, the agency shall make available to the requesting
  4 19 party a copy of the contents of the recording. If an objection
  4 20 is made, the objecting party has thirty days to petition the
  4 21 district court to order that the contents of the recording not
  4 22 be released, otherwise the contents of the recording shall be
  4 23 released.
  4 24    g.  Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a

  4 26 responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording on
  4 27 behalf of the agency, shall review all applicable and available
  4 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  4 29 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  4 30 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  4 31 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  4 32 of if such a reason exists.
  4 33    7.  A peace officer who fails to record any interaction as
  4 34 required by this section or who fails to stop recording an
  4 35 interaction as required by this section shall be considered
  5  1 to have committed a violation of this section. For a first
  5  2 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  5  3 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  5  4 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the
  5  5 violation has been completed.
  5  6    8.  If during a criminal prosecution or civil action an
  5  7 agency is unable to produce a body camera recording required
  5  8 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  5  9 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the
  5 10 version of the facts advanced by the defendant in the criminal
  5 11 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5 12 civil action.
  5 13    9.  An agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body
  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested
  4 12 recording.
  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a

  5  1 to have committed a violation of this section. For a first
  5  2 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  5  3 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  5  4 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the

  5  7 agency is unable to produce a body camera recording required

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.

  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the

  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.

  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.

  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of

  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written

  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.

  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of

  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of

  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state

  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.

  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of

  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state

  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  3 16 evidence in the criminal prosecution and the time period to
  3 17 retain the contents of the recording under paragraph "a" or "b"
  3 18 shall be extended to equal the time period for the retention of

  4  3 to disclose the contents of the recording to the other person.
  4  4    (2)  Such person making such a request is not required to
  4  5 file a complaint and the contents of the recording are not
  4  6 required to be part of an investigation in order for a person
  4  7 to make such a request.
  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body
  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested
  4 12 recording.
  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a
  4 14 recording created by a body camera, may request a copy of such
  4 15 recording.  Before the request is granted, each person who is
  4 16 part of the contents of the recording shall be notified of
  4 17 the request and may object to the request.  If no objection
  4 18 is made, the agency shall make available to the requesting
  4 19 party a copy of the contents of the recording. If an objection
  4 20 is made, the objecting party has thirty days to petition the

  4 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  4 29 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  4 30 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  4 31 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  4 32 of if such a reason exists.

  5  2 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  5  3 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  5  4 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the
  5  5 violation has been completed.
  5  6    8.  If during a criminal prosecution or civil action an
  5  7 agency is unable to produce a body camera recording required

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.

  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,

  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body
  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested

  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a

  4 15 recording.  Before the request is granted, each person who is
  4 16 part of the contents of the recording shall be notified of
  4 17 the request and may object to the request.  If no objection
  4 18 is made, the agency shall make available to the requesting

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4  2 division (a) or (b) has given written authority to the agency
  4  3 to disclose the contents of the recording to the other person.
  4  4    (2)  Such person making such a request is not required to

  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body
  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested
  4 12 recording.
  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a
  4 14 recording created by a body camera, may request a copy of such
  4 15 recording.  Before the request is granted, each person who is
  4 16 part of the contents of the recording shall be notified of
  4 17 the request and may object to the request.  If no objection
  4 18 is made, the agency shall make available to the requesting

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4 29 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  4 30 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  4 31 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  4 32 of if such a reason exists.
  4 33    7.  A peace officer who fails to record any interaction as
  4 34 required by this section or who fails to stop recording an

  5 11 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5 12 civil action.
  5 13    9.  An agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a

  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of

  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order

  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording

  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available

  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first

  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation

  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement

  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of

  4  5 file a complaint and the contents of the recording are not
  4  6 required to be part of an investigation in order for a person
  4  7 to make such a request.
  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body
  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested
  4 12 recording.
  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a
  4 14 recording created by a body camera, may request a copy of such
  4 15 recording.  Before the request is granted, each person who is
  4 16 part of the contents of the recording shall be notified of
  4 17 the request and may object to the request.  If no objection
  4 18 is made, the agency shall make available to the requesting
  4 19 party a copy of the contents of the recording. If an objection
  4 20 is made, the objecting party has thirty days to petition the
  4 21 district court to order that the contents of the recording not
  4 22 be released, otherwise the contents of the recording shall be
  4 23 released.

  4 26 responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording on
  4 27 behalf of the agency, shall review all applicable and available
  4 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  4 29 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  4 30 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  4 31 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  4 32 of if such a reason exists.

  5  2 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  5  3 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  5  4 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the
  5  5 violation has been completed.
  5  6    8.  If during a criminal prosecution or civil action an
  5  7 agency is unable to produce a body camera recording required
  5  8 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  5  9 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the
  5 10 version of the facts advanced by the defendant in the criminal
  5 11 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5 12 civil action.
  5 13    9.  An agency shall participate in any existing state or
  5 14 federal programs that fund or supplement the costs to purchase

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.

  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of

  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or

  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that

  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or

  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.

  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or

  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested

  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a

  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,

  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the

  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when

  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to

  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record

  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to

  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff

  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to

  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record

  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a

  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to

  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.

  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation

  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of

  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested

  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal

  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of

  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff

  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an

  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by

  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be

  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a

  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the

  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each

  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of

  5 15 and maintain body cameras worn by peace officers.
  5 16    Sec. 3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.2, subsection
  5 17 3, shall not apply to this Act.
  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4  8    (3)  A person making such a request may view and make or
  4  9 request a copy of the contents of a recording created by a body
  4 10 camera. The agency retaining the contents of the recording
  4 11 shall provide such a person with a copy of the requested
  4 12 recording.
  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a
  4 14 recording created by a body camera, may request a copy of such
  4 15 recording.  Before the request is granted, each person who is
  4 16 part of the contents of the recording shall be notified of
  4 17 the request and may object to the request.  If no objection
  4 18 is made, the agency shall make available to the requesting
  4 19 party a copy of the contents of the recording. If an objection
  4 20 is made, the objecting party has thirty days to petition the

  4 22 be released, otherwise the contents of the recording shall be
  4 23 released.
  4 24    g.  Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a

  4 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  4 29 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  4 30 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  4 31 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  4 32 of if such a reason exists.
  4 33    7.  A peace officer who fails to record any interaction as
  4 34 required by this section or who fails to stop recording an
  4 35 interaction as required by this section shall be considered
  5  1 to have committed a violation of this section. For a first
  5  2 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  5  3 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  5  4 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the

  5  6    8.  If during a criminal prosecution or civil action an
  5  7 agency is unable to produce a body camera recording required

  5 10 version of the facts advanced by the defendant in the criminal
  5 11 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5 12 civil action.
  5 13    9.  An agency shall participate in any existing state or

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff

  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the

  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing

  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a

  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to

  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  4 13    f.  A person, who is not a part of the contents of a
  4 14 recording created by a body camera, may request a copy of such
  4 15 recording.  Before the request is granted, each person who is
  4 16 part of the contents of the recording shall be notified of
  4 17 the request and may object to the request.  If no objection
  4 18 is made, the agency shall make available to the requesting
  4 19 party a copy of the contents of the recording. If an objection
  4 20 is made, the objecting party has thirty days to petition the
  4 21 district court to order that the contents of the recording not
  4 22 be released, otherwise the contents of the recording shall be
  4 23 released.
  4 24    g.  Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a
  4 25 recording created by a body camera, the person who has the
  4 26 responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording on

  4 28 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  4 29 exists that the recording should not be deleted or disposed of
  4 30 under this section or under the policies of the agency. The
  4 31 contents of such a recording shall not be deleted or disposed
  4 32 of if such a reason exists.
  4 33    7.  A peace officer who fails to record any interaction as
  4 34 required by this section or who fails to stop recording an

  5  2 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  5  3 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  5  4 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the
  5  5 violation has been completed.
  5  6    8.  If during a criminal prosecution or civil action an

  5  8 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  5  9 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the
  5 10 version of the facts advanced by the defendant in the criminal
  5 11 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5 12 civil action.
  5 13    9.  An agency shall participate in any existing state or
  5 14 federal programs that fund or supplement the costs to purchase

  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first

  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any

  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order

  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of

  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the

  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.

  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to

  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a

  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order

  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first

  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation

  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the

  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record

  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 17 3, shall not apply to this Act.
  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5  1 to have committed a violation of this section. For a first
  5  2 violation a peace officer shall be given a written reprimand.
  5  3 For a second or subsequent violation the peace officer shall
  5  4 be suspended until an investigation into the cause of the

  5 12 civil action.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5  8 to be made and retained pursuant to this section, a rebuttable
  5  9 presumption arises that the recording would corroborate the
  5 10 version of the facts advanced by the defendant in the criminal
  5 11 action or the party opposing the peace officer or agency in the
  5 12 civil action.
  5 13    9.  An agency shall participate in any existing state or
  5 14 federal programs that fund or supplement the costs to purchase
  5 15 and maintain body cameras worn by peace officers.
  5 16    Sec. 3.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.2, subsection
  5 17 3, shall not apply to this Act.
  5 18                           EXPLANATION
  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an

  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the

  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a

  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each

  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  5 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 21    This bill requires certain peace officers, including tribal
  5 22 law enforcement officers, to wear and use a body camera.
  5 23    The bill defines "agency" to mean a law enforcement agency.
  5 24    The bill defines "body camera" to mean an electronic device
  5 25 that is capable of recording video and audio data or capable of
  5 26 transmitting video and audio data to be recorded remotely, and
  5 27 is worn on the person of a peace officer.
  5 28    The contents of the body camera recording shall be a public
  5 29 record and the release of the contents of such a recording
  5 30 shall be governed by new Code section 801C.1 which is created
  5 31 in the bill.
  5 32    The body camera requirement applies to a county sheriff
  5 33 or deputy sheriff, city peace officer, peace officer member
  5 34 of the department of public safety, peace officer at a
  5 35 regents institution, conservation officer, an employee of the
  6  1 department of transportation designated as a peace officer,
  6  2 an employee of an aviation authority designated as a peace
  6  3 officer, and a certified tribal law enforcement officer.
  6  4    The bill requires a peace officer to wear a body camera
  6  5 at all times while on duty and in uniform.  The bill further
  6  6 requires that the peace officer record all interactions with
  6  7 people in the performance of the official duties of the peace
  6  8 officer from the beginning to the end of those interactions.
  6  9    The bill specifies that a body camera must be worn on the
  6 10 chest or at the eye level of the peace officer.
  6 11    The bill prohibits a body camera from containing facial
  6 12 recognition technology unless the use of such technology has
  6 13 been authorized by the court pursuant to an arrest or search
  6 14 warrant.
  6 15    The bill requires a peace officer to inform a person when
  6 16 that person is being recorded by a body camera unless informing
  6 17 the person would be unsafe, impractical, or impossible.
  6 18    If a peace officer who is wearing a body camera enters a
  6 19 residence without a warrant or where no exigent circumstances
  6 20 exist, the bill requires that the peace officer immediately ask
  6 21 a resident whether the resident desires the peace officer to
  6 22 stop the body camera recording while the peace officer is in
  6 23 the residence. If the resident responds in the affirmative,
  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  6 24 the bill requires the peace officer to stop the body camera
  6 25 recording.  The bill also requires the peace officer to record
  6 26 the question and any answer to the question.
  6 27    If a peace officer wearing a body camera interacts with a
  6 28 person reporting a crime, providing information regarding a
  6 29 crime or ongoing investigation, or claiming to be a victim of a
  6 30 crime, the bill requires the peace officer to immediately ask
  6 31 whether the person desires the peace officer to stop the body
  6 32 camera recording of the interaction.  If the person responds in
  6 33 the affirmative, the bill requires the peace officer to stop
  6 34 the body camera recording.  The bill also requires the peace
  6 35 officer to record the question and any answer to the question.
  7  1 The bill requires that an agency shall retain the contents of
  7  2 a recording created by a body camera for 30 days.  However, an
  7  3 agency shall retain the contents of a recording created by a
  7  4 body camera for three years if any of the following apply: the
  7  5 recording depicts an incident involving the use of force; the
  7  6 recording depicts an incident that leads to detention or arrest
  7  7 of a person; the recording is relevant to a formal or informal
  7  8 complaint against a peace officer or agency; or a request by
  7  9 an interested or authorized person has been made to retain the
  7 10 recording.  Under the bill, the contents of the recording may
  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or
  7 17 damaged in relation to, or is otherwise involved with, a crime
  7 18 that is related to the recording; a parent or guardian of a
  7 19 person who is part of the contents of the recording or whose
  7 20 property was seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that
  7 21 is related to the recording; the attorney for a person who is
  7 22 part of the contents of the recording or whose property was
  7 23 seized, damaged, or involved with a crime that is related to
  7 24 the recording; any other person if such person has been given
  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or
  7 27 whose property was seized or damaged.
  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the
  7 29 contents of a recording created by a body camera, may request a
  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each
  7 31 person who is part of the contents of the recording shall be
  7 32 notified of the request and may object to the request.  If
  7 33 no objection is made, the bill requires the agency to make
  7 34 available to the requesting party a copy of the contents of
  7 35 the recording. If an objection is made, the bill allows the
  8  1 objecting party 30 days to petition the district court to order
  8  2 that the contents not be released, otherwise the contents of
  8  3 the recording shall be released.
  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with
  8 11 a person or who fails to stop recording such interaction
  8 12 as required by the bill commits a violation. For a first
  8 13 violation of the bill a peace officer shall be given a written
  8 14 reprimand.  For a second or subsequent violation of the bill
  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  8 30 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  8 31 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  8 32 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  8 33 mandate included in the bill.

  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the

  7 11 be retained even longer than three years if the contents may be
  7 12 relevant to a criminal prosecution.
  7 13    Any of the following persons may make a request that the
  7 14 contents of a recording created by a body camera be retained
  7 15 for three years: a person who is a part of the contents of
  7 16 the recording; a person whose property has been seized or

  7 25 written authority to disclose the contents of the recording
  7 26 by the person who is part of the contents of the recording or

  7 28    The bill provides that a person, who is not a part of the

  7 30 copy of such recording.  Before the request is granted, each

  8  4    Prior to deleting or disposing of the contents of a recording
  8  5 created by a body camera, the bill requires the person who has
  8  6 the responsibility of deleting or disposing of such a recording
  8  7 on behalf of the agency to review all applicable and available
  8  8 records, files, and databases to ascertain whether any reason
  8  9 exists that the recording should not be disposed of or deleted.
  8 10    A peace officer who fails to record any interaction with

  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.
  8 17    The bill also provides that if during a criminal prosecution
  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,

  8 15 the peace officer shall be suspended until an investigation
  8 16 into the cause of the violation has been completed.

  8 18 or civil action an agency is unable to produce a body camera
  8 19 recording, a rebuttable presumption arises that the recording
  8 20 would corroborate the version of the facts advanced by the
  8 21 defendant in the criminal action or the party opposing the
  8 22 peace officer or agency in the civil action.
  8 23    The bill specifies that an agency shall participate in any
  8 24 existing state or federal programs that fund or supplement
  8 25 the costs to purchase and maintain body cameras worn by peace
  8 26 officers.
  8 27    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  8 28 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  8 29 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
