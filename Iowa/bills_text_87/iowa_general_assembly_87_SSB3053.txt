Section

Section
535.8,
subsection
4,
paragraph
e,
1


subparagraph
(1),
Code
2018,
is
amended
to
read
as
follows:
2


(1)
Notwithstanding
section
628.3
when
a
foreclosure
of
a
3


mortgage
on
real
property
results
from
the
enforcement
of
a
4


due-on-sale
clause,
the
mortgagor
may
redeem
the
real
property
5


at
any
time
within
three
years


eighteen
months
from
the
day
of
6


sale
under
the
levy,
and
the
mortgagor
shall,
in
the
meantime,
7


be
entitled
to
the
possession
thereof;
and
for
the
first
8


thirty


fifteen
months
thereafter
such
right
of
redemption
is
9


exclusive.
Any
real
property
redeemed
by
the
debtor
shall
10


thereafter
be
free
and
clear
from
any
liability
for
any
unpaid
11


portion
of
the
judgment
under
which
the
real
property
was
12


sold.
The
right
of
redemption
established
by
this
paragraph
13


is
not
subject
to
waiver
by
the
mortgagor
and
the
period
of
14


redemption
established
by
this
paragraph
shall
not
be
reduced.
15


The
times
for
redemption
by
creditors
provided
in
sections
16


628.5
,
628.15
,


and
628.16
shall
be
extended
to
thirty-three
17


sixteen


months
in
any
case
in
which
the
mortgagor’s
period
18


for
redemption
is
extended
by
this
paragraph.
This
paragraph
19


does
not
apply
to
foreclosure
of
a
mortgage
if
for
any
reason
20


other
than
enforcement
of
a
due-on-sale
clause.
As
used
in
21


this
paragraph,
“due-on-sale
clause”
means
any
type
of
covenant
22


which
gives
the
mortgagee
the
right
to
demand
payment
of
the
23


outstanding
balance
or
a
major
part
thereof
upon
a
transfer
by
24


the
mortgagor
to
a
third
party
of
an
interest
of
the
mortgagor
25


in
property
covered
by
the
mortgage.
This
paragraph
applies
to
26


any
foreclosure
occurring
on
or
after
May
10,
1980.
However,
27


this
paragraph
does
not
apply
if
the
lender
establishes,
based
28


on
reasonable
criteria
which
are
not
more
restrictive
than
29


those
used
to
evaluate
new
mortgage-loan
applications,
that
the
30


security
interest
or
the
likelihood
of
repayment
is
impaired
as
31


a
result
of
the
transfer
of
interest.

Sec.
8.
Section
654.21,
Code
2018,
is
amended
to
read
as
1


follows:
2


654.21
Demand
for
delay
of
sale.
3


At
any
time
prior
to
entry
of
judgment,
the
mortgagor
may
4


file
a
demand
for
delay
of
sale.
If
the
demand
is
filed,
the
5


sale
shall
be
held
promptly
after
the
expiration
of
two
months
6


from
entry
of
judgment.
However,
if
the
demand
is
filed
and
7


the
mortgaged
property
is
the
residence
of
the
mortgagor
and
8


is
a
one-family
or
two-family
dwelling,
the
sale
shall
be
held
9


promptly
after
the
expiration
of
twelve


six
months,
or
six
10


three


months
if
the
petition
includes
a
waiver
of
deficiency
11


judgment,
from
entry
of
judgment.
If
the
demand
is
filed,
the
12


mortgagor
and
mortgagee
subsequently
may
file
a
stipulation
13


that
the
sale
may
be
held
promptly
after
the
stipulation
is
14


filed
and
that
the
mortgagee
waives
the
right
to
entry
of
a
15


deficiency
judgment.
If
the
stipulation
is
filed,
the
sale
16


shall
be
held
promptly
after
the
filing.
At
any
time
prior
17


to
judgment,
the
mortgagor
may
pay
the
plaintiff
the
amount
18


claimed
in
the
petition
and,
if
paid,
the
foreclosure
action
19


shall
be
dismissed.
At
any
time
after
judgment
and
before
20


the
sale,
the
mortgagor
may
pay
the
plaintiff
the
amount
of
21


the
judgment
and,
if
paid,
the
judgment
shall
be
satisfied
of
22


record
and
the
sale
shall
not
be
held.
23


EXPLANATION
24


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
25


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
26


This
bill
shortens
the
periods
of
time
associated
with
27


redemption
of
real
property
from
foreclosure
in
Code
chapter
28


628.
It
changes
the
period
of
time
that
a
defendant-debtor
may
29


redeem
real
property
from
within
one
year
of
sale
to
within
30


six
months
of
sale.
It
also
changes
the
period
in
which
the
31


defendant-debtor
has
the
exclusive
right
of
redemption
from
six
32


months
after
sale
to
three
months
after
sale.
The
period
of
33


redemption
by
creditors
is
reduced
from
nine
months
after
sale
34


to
four
months
after
sale.
After
those
four
months,
creditors
35

S.F.
_____


cannot
redeem
from
each
other.
Unless
the
defendant-debtor
1


redeems,
the
purchaser,
or
the
creditor
who
last
redeemed
2


within
four
months
of
the
day
of
sale,
will
hold
the
property
3


absolutely.
4


Under
current
law,
a
mortgagor
and
mortgagee
can
agree
to
5


reduce
the
period
of
redemption
from
foreclosure
as
described
6


in
the
mortgage
instrument
to
a
period
of
six
months.
The
bill
7


would
allow
the
mortgagor
and
mortgagee
to
agree
to
reduce
8


the
period
of
redemption
by
the
debtor
to
three
months.
The
9


debtor’s
right
of
redemption
would
be
exclusive
the
first
10


month,
as
opposed
to
three
months.
Under
the
bill,
the
time
11


for
redemption
by
creditors
would
be
shortened
from
four
months
12


to
two
months.
13


The
bill
also
alters
Code
chapter
654.
The
bill
changes
14


the
notice
requirement
and
rule
for
foreclosure
without
15


redemption
by
changing
the
length
of
time
a
sale
can
be
16


delayed
when
a
defendant-mortgagor
makes
a
written
demand
to
a
17


plaintiff-mortgagee
to
delay
sale.
The
bill
delays
the
sale
by
18


six
months
from
entry
of
judgment
as
opposed
to
the
current
12
19


months.
If
a
plaintiff-mortgagee’s
petition
includes
a
waiver
20


of
deficiency
judgment,
a
defendant-mortgagor’s
written
demand
21


will
only
result
in
a
three-month
rather
than
a
six-month
delay
22


of
sale
following
entry
of
judgment.
23


Notwithstanding
Code
section
628.3
when
a
foreclosure
of
24


a
mortgage
on
real
property
results
from
enforcement
of
a
25


due-on-sale
clause,
the
bill
amends
Code
section
535.8(4)(e)(1)
26


to
shorten
the
period
that
a
mortgagor
may
redeem
the
real
27


property
from
any
time
within
three
years
to
anytime
within
28


18
months
from
the
day
of
sale
under
the
levy.
The
bill
also
29


shortens
the
period
during
which
the
mortgagor’s
right
of
30


redemption
is
exclusive
from
the
first
30
months
to
the
first
31


15
months
and
the
period
during
which
creditors
may
redeem
32


under
Code
sections
628.5,
628.15,
and
628.16
from
33
months


33


to
16
months.
