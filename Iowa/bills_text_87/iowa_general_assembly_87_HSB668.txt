DELINQUENT
ACTS
——
TRESPASS.
Current
law
defines
a
3


delinquent
act
as
the
violation
of
any
state
law
or
local
4


ordinance
which
would
constitute
a
public
offense
if
committed
5


by
an
adult.
The
bill
expands
the
definition
of
a
delinquent
6


act
to
include
the
violation
of
Code
section
716.8
(relating
7


to
trespassing).
Despite
adult
violations
being
treated
as
8


scheduled
violations,
misdemeanors,
or
felonies,
all
trespass
9


violations
by
children
would
be
treated
as
delinquent
acts
in
10


the
juvenile

11


DETENTION

SHELTER
CARE
HEARING.
Under
current
law,
12


a

for
a

who
is
alleged
to
have
committed
a
13


delinquent
act
is
required
to
be
held
within
48
hours
of
the
14


time
of
the
child’s
admission
to
a
shelter
care
facility,
15


and
within
24
hours
of
the
time
of
a
child’s
admission
to
a
16


detention
facility,
excluding
Saturdays,
Sundays,
and

The
bill

to
provide
that
a
18


hearing
is
required
to
be
held
within
two
working
days
of
19


the
time
of
the

If
the

is
not

within

JUVENILE
DELINQUENCY

OTHER
THAN

9


RECORDS.
Current
Code
section
232.147(2)
provides
that
10


official

are
confidential

therefore
11


are

except
in

alleging
the

that
