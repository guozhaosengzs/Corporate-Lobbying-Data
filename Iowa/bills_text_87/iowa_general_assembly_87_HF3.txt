  1 21    This bill relates to the statute=of=repose period in a
  1 22 case arising out of the unsafe or defective condition of an
  1 23 improvement to real property.
  1 24    Under current law, a case arising out of the unsafe or
  1 25 defective condition of an improvement to real property is
  1 26 subject to a 15=year statute of repose. Such cases are based
  1 27 upon an injury to property or an injury or death of a person.
  1 28 The bill reduces the period of the statute of repose from 15
  1 29 years to 8 years.
  1 30    A statute=of=repose period differs from a
  1 31 statute=of=limitations period in that a statute of repose
  1 32 establishes a time period after which a lawsuit based upon
  1 33 negligence in an improvement to real property cannot be filed
  1 34 regardless of whether an injury to a person or to property has
  1 35 occurred. A statute=of=limitations period begins at the date
  2  1 of the injury or upon discovery of the deficiency.

  1 18                           EXPLANATION
  1 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 21    This bill relates to the statute=of=repose period in a
  1 22 case arising out of the unsafe or defective condition of an
  1 23 improvement to real property.
  1 24    Under current law, a case arising out of the unsafe or
  1 25 defective condition of an improvement to real property is
  1 26 subject to a 15=year statute of repose. Such cases are based
  1 27 upon an injury to property or an injury or death of a person.
  1 28 The bill reduces the period of the statute of repose from 15
  1 29 years to 8 years.
  1 30    A statute=of=repose period differs from a
  1 31 statute=of=limitations period in that a statute of repose
  1 32 establishes a time period after which a lawsuit based upon
  1 33 negligence in an improvement to real property cannot be filed
  1 34 regardless of whether an injury to a person or to property has
  1 35 occurred. A statute=of=limitations period begins at the date
  2  1 of the injury or upon discovery of the deficiency.
  2  2    The bill does not reduce the statute of repose for real
  2  3 property improvements in existence prior to the effective date
  2  4 of the bill.
