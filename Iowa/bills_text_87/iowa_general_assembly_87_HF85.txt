  3 13                           EXPLANATION
  3 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 16    This bill prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle
  3 17 while using a mobile telephone unless the mobile telephone
  3 18 is specifically designed and configured to allow hands=free
  3 19 listening and talking and is used in that manner.  The bill
  3 20 does not apply to the driver of a motor vehicle when the motor
  3 21 vehicle is at a complete stop off the traveled portion of the
  3 22 roadway.  In addition, the bill exempts the following persons
  3 23 from the prohibition:  a member of a public safety agency
  3 24 performing official duties; a health care professional in
  3 25 the course of an emergency situation; and a person receiving
  3 26 safety=related information including emergency, traffic, or
  3 27 weather alerts.  These are the same exemptions that currently
  3 28 apply under Iowa law prohibiting text=messaging while driving.
  3 29    The bill defines "mobile telephone" to mean the same
  3 30 as defined in federal motor carrier safety administration
  3 31 regulations.  Under that definition, "mobile telephone" means
  3 32 a mobile communication device that falls under or uses any
  3 33 commercial mobile radio service, as defined in regulations of
  3 34 the federal communications commission.  The federal definition
  3 35 explicitly excludes two=way or citizens band radio services.
  4  1 The bill amends current provisions prohibiting
  4  2 text=messaging while driving to specify that a person does not
  4  3 violate the text=messaging provisions by using a fixed unit
  4  4 global positioning system or navigation system, provided the
  4  5 person does not enter data into the system while operating
  4  6 the motor vehicle.  "Fixed unit global positioning system or
  4  7 navigation system" is defined as an electronic device mounted
  4  8 inside a motor vehicle and capable of providing navigation
  4  9 directions to a driver based on data entered into the device.
  4 10 The bill also strikes a current exception to the prohibition
  4 11 on text=messaging while driving which applies to a person
  4 12 selecting or entering a telephone number or name in a hand=held
  4 13 mobile telephone or activating, deactivating, or initiating a
  4 14 function of a hand=held mobile telephone.
  4 15    The penalties established in the bill mirror the penalties
  4 16 currently applicable for text=messaging while driving.  A
  4 17 person who uses a mobile telephone while driving in violation
  4 18 of the bill commits a simple misdemeanor punishable by
  4 19 a scheduled fine of $30.  The offense is not a moving
  4 20 violation, and therefore cannot be considered for purposes of
  4 21 administrative suspension of a driver's license or to establish
  4 22 habitual offender status.  However, if the violation causes a
  4 23 serious injury, a court could impose an additional fine of $500
  4 24 or suspend the person's driver's license for not more than 90
  4 25 days, or both.  If the violation causes a death, a court could
  4 26 impose an additional fine of $1,000 or suspend the person's
  4 27 driver's license for not more than 180 days, or both.
  4 28    The bill does not authorize a peace officer to confiscate a
  4 29 mobile telephone from a driver or occupant of a motor vehicle.
  4 30 However, a peace officer may stop or detain a driver solely for
  4 31 using a hand=held mobile telephone while driving.

  3 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 16    This bill prohibits a person from driving a motor vehicle
  3 17 while using a mobile telephone unless the mobile telephone
  3 18 is specifically designed and configured to allow hands=free
  3 19 listening and talking and is used in that manner.  The bill
  3 20 does not apply to the driver of a motor vehicle when the motor
  3 21 vehicle is at a complete stop off the traveled portion of the
  3 22 roadway.  In addition, the bill exempts the following persons
  3 23 from the prohibition:  a member of a public safety agency
  3 24 performing official duties; a health care professional in
  3 25 the course of an emergency situation; and a person receiving
  3 26 safety=related information including emergency, traffic, or
  3 27 weather alerts.  These are the same exemptions that currently
  3 28 apply under Iowa law prohibiting text=messaging while driving.
  3 29    The bill defines "mobile telephone" to mean the same
  3 30 as defined in federal motor carrier safety administration
  3 31 regulations.  Under that definition, "mobile telephone" means
  3 32 a mobile communication device that falls under or uses any
  3 33 commercial mobile radio service, as defined in regulations of
  3 34 the federal communications commission.  The federal definition
  3 35 explicitly excludes two=way or citizens band radio services.
  4  1 The bill amends current provisions prohibiting
  4  2 text=messaging while driving to specify that a person does not
  4  3 violate the text=messaging provisions by using a fixed unit
  4  4 global positioning system or navigation system, provided the
  4  5 person does not enter data into the system while operating
  4  6 the motor vehicle.  "Fixed unit global positioning system or
  4  7 navigation system" is defined as an electronic device mounted
  4  8 inside a motor vehicle and capable of providing navigation
  4  9 directions to a driver based on data entered into the device.
  4 10 The bill also strikes a current exception to the prohibition
  4 11 on text=messaging while driving which applies to a person
  4 12 selecting or entering a telephone number or name in a hand=held
  4 13 mobile telephone or activating, deactivating, or initiating a
  4 14 function of a hand=held mobile telephone.
  4 15    The penalties established in the bill mirror the penalties
  4 16 currently applicable for text=messaging while driving.  A
  4 17 person who uses a mobile telephone while driving in violation
  4 18 of the bill commits a simple misdemeanor punishable by
  4 19 a scheduled fine of $30.  The offense is not a moving
  4 20 violation, and therefore cannot be considered for purposes of
  4 21 administrative suspension of a driver's license or to establish
  4 22 habitual offender status.  However, if the violation causes a
  4 23 serious injury, a court could impose an additional fine of $500
  4 24 or suspend the person's driver's license for not more than 90
  4 25 days, or both.  If the violation causes a death, a court could
  4 26 impose an additional fine of $1,000 or suspend the person's
  4 27 driver's license for not more than 180 days, or both.
  4 28    The bill does not authorize a peace officer to confiscate a
  4 29 mobile telephone from a driver or occupant of a motor vehicle.
  4 30 However, a peace officer may stop or detain a driver solely for

  4 20 violation, and therefore cannot be considered for purposes of
  4 21 administrative suspension of a driver's license or to establish
  4 22 habitual offender status.  However, if the violation causes a
  4 23 serious injury, a court could impose an additional fine of $500
  4 24 or suspend the person's driver's license for not more than 90
  4 25 days, or both.  If the violation causes a death, a court could
