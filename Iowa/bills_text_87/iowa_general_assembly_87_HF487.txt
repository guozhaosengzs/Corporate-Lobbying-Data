  5 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 34    This bill relates to medical malpractice claims, including
  5 35 expert witnesses and defenses.
  6  1 ADVERSE HEALTH CARE INCIDENTS.  Under Code chapter 135P, if
  6  2 an adverse health care incident occurs, a health care provider
  6  3 may offer to engage in an open discussion with the patient. If
  6  4 the patient agrees, the health care provider may investigate
  6  5 the incident, disclose the results to the patient, and discuss
  6  6 steps the health care provider will take to prevent similar
  6  7 incidents. The health care provider may also communicate to
  6  8 the patient whether the health care provider believes that
  6  9 an offer of compensation is warranted. All communications
  6 10 made related to the open discussion are privileged and
  6 11 confidential, are not subject to discovery or subpoena, and
  6 12 are not admissible in evidence in a judicial, administrative,
  6 13 or arbitration proceeding. Under current Code chapter 135P,
  6 14 "health care provider" is defined as a physician licensed under
  6 15 Code chapter 148, a physician assistant licensed under Code
  6 16 chapter 148C, a podiatrist licensed under Code chapter 149, or
  6 17 an advanced registered nurse practitioner licensed pursuant

  6 27 pharmacist licensed under chapter 155A, or any other person who
  6 28 is licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized or permitted by
  6 29 the law of this state to administer health care in the ordinary
  6 30 course of business or in the practice of a profession.
  6 31    EXPERT WITNESSES IN MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CASES.  The
  6 32 bill provides standards for an expert witness in a medical
  6 33 malpractice case. The bill provides that a person is
  6 34 only qualified to serve as an expert witness in a medical
  6 35 malpractice case if the person is a licensed health care
  7  1 provider, is in good standing in each state of licensure, and
  7  2 in the five years preceding the act or omission alleged to
  7  3 be negligent, has not had a license in any state revoked or
  7  4 suspended; in the five years preceding the act or omission
  7  5 alleged to be negligent, actively practiced in the same field
  7  6 as the defendant or was a qualified instructor at an accredited
  7  7 university in the same field as the defendant; practiced or
  7  8 provided instruction in the same or substantially similar
  7  9 specialty as the defendant; is trained and experienced in the
  7 10 same discipline or school of practice as the defendant or
  7 11 has specialty expertise in the disease process or procedure
  7 12 performed in the case; and, if the defendant is board=certified
  7 13 in a specialty, the person is certified in the same specialty.
  7 14    The bill establishes a requirement for a certificate of
  7 15 merit affidavit for expert witnesses in medical malpractice
  7 16 cases. In an action for personal injury or wrongful death
  7 17 against a health care provider based upon alleged negligence
  7 18 in the practice of that profession or in patient care, the
  7 19 bill requires the plaintiff, within 90 days of the defendant's
  7 20 answer, to serve upon the defendant a certificate of merit
  7 21 affidavit for each expert witness who will testify with respect
  7 22 to the issues of standard of care, breach of standard of care,
  7 23 or causation.  A certificate of merit affidavit must be signed
  7 24 by the expert witness and certify the purpose for calling
  7 25 the expert witness by providing under the oath of the expert
  7 26 witness the expert witness's statement of familiarity with the
  7 27 applicable standard of care; statement that the standard of
  7 28 care was breached by the health care provider; statement of the
  7 29 actions that the health care provider failed to take or should
  7 30 have taken; and statement of the manner by which the breach of
  7 31 the standard of care was the cause of the injury.
  7 32    The bill provides that answers to interrogatories may
  7 33 serve as an expert witness's certificate of merit affidavit
  7 34 if the interrogatories satisfy the requirements of the bill.
  7 35 The bill provides that the expert witness's certificate of
  8  1 merit affidavit does not preclude additional discovery and
  8  2 supplementation of the expert witness's opinions.
  8  3    The bill provides that failure to substantially comply with
  8  4 the new requirements shall result, upon motion, in dismissal
  8  5 with prejudice of each cause of action as to which expert
  8  6 witness testimony is necessary to establish a prima facie
  8  7 case. A written notice of deficiency may be served upon the
  8  8 plaintiff for failure to comply with the bill requirements
  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20
  8 11 days to cure the deficiency. Failure to comply within the 20
  8 12 days shall result, upon motion, in mandatory dismissal with
  8 13 prejudice of each action as to which expert witness testimony
  8 14 is necessary to establish a prima facie case.
  8 15    EVIDENCE=BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES.  The bill
  8 16 defines "evidence=based medical practice guidelines" as
  8 17 voluntary medical practice parameters or protocols established
  8 18 and released through a recognized physician consensus=building
  8 19 organization.
  8 20    The bill provides that in any action for personal injury
  8 21 or wrongful death against a health care provider based
  8 22 upon the alleged negligence of the health care provider in
  8 23 patient care, the health care provider may establish as an
  8 24 affirmative defense that the health care provider complied with
  8 25 evidence=based medical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and
  8 26 treatment of the patient.
  8 27    The bill provides that the court shall admit evidence=based
  8 28 medical practice guidelines into evidence if introduced by a
  8 29 health care provider or the health care provider's employer
  8 30 and if the health care provider or the health care provider's
  8 31 employer submits evidence that the evidence=based medical
  8 32 practice guideline was appropriate for the patient and that
  8 33 the health care provider complied with such evidence=based
  8 34 medical practice guidelines. Evidence of departure from a
  8 35 guideline is admissible only on the issue of whether the health
  9  1 care provider is entitled to establish an affirmative defense
  9  2 under the bill. There shall be no presumption of negligence
  9  3 if a health care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based
  9  4 medical practice guideline.

  7 14    The bill establishes a requirement for a certificate of

  6  1 ADVERSE HEALTH CARE INCIDENTS.  Under Code chapter 135P, if
  6  2 an adverse health care incident occurs, a health care provider
  6  3 may offer to engage in an open discussion with the patient. If
  6  4 the patient agrees, the health care provider may investigate
  6  5 the incident, disclose the results to the patient, and discuss
  6  6 steps the health care provider will take to prevent similar
  6  7 incidents. The health care provider may also communicate to
  6  8 the patient whether the health care provider believes that
  6  9 an offer of compensation is warranted. All communications
  6 10 made related to the open discussion are privileged and
  6 11 confidential, are not subject to discovery or subpoena, and
  6 12 are not admissible in evidence in a judicial, administrative,
  6 13 or arbitration proceeding. Under current Code chapter 135P,
  6 14 "health care provider" is defined as a physician licensed under
  6 15 Code chapter 148, a physician assistant licensed under Code
  6 16 chapter 148C, a podiatrist licensed under Code chapter 149, or

  7  2 in the five years preceding the act or omission alleged to
  7  3 be negligent, has not had a license in any state revoked or
  7  4 suspended; in the five years preceding the act or omission
  7  5 alleged to be negligent, actively practiced in the same field
  7  6 as the defendant or was a qualified instructor at an accredited

  7 14    The bill establishes a requirement for a certificate of
  7 15 merit affidavit for expert witnesses in medical malpractice
  7 16 cases. In an action for personal injury or wrongful death

  7 18 in the practice of that profession or in patient care, the
  7 19 bill requires the plaintiff, within 90 days of the defendant's
  7 20 answer, to serve upon the defendant a certificate of merit
  7 21 affidavit for each expert witness who will testify with respect
  7 22 to the issues of standard of care, breach of standard of care,
  7 23 or causation.  A certificate of merit affidavit must be signed
  7 24 by the expert witness and certify the purpose for calling
  7 25 the expert witness by providing under the oath of the expert
  7 26 witness the expert witness's statement of familiarity with the
  7 27 applicable standard of care; statement that the standard of
  7 28 care was breached by the health care provider; statement of the
  7 29 actions that the health care provider failed to take or should
  7 30 have taken; and statement of the manner by which the breach of
  7 31 the standard of care was the cause of the injury.
  7 32    The bill provides that answers to interrogatories may
  7 33 serve as an expert witness's certificate of merit affidavit
  7 34 if the interrogatories satisfy the requirements of the bill.
  7 35 The bill provides that the expert witness's certificate of
  8  1 merit affidavit does not preclude additional discovery and
  8  2 supplementation of the expert witness's opinions.
  8  3    The bill provides that failure to substantially comply with
  8  4 the new requirements shall result, upon motion, in dismissal
  8  5 with prejudice of each cause of action as to which expert
  8  6 witness testimony is necessary to establish a prima facie
  8  7 case. A written notice of deficiency may be served upon the
  8  8 plaintiff for failure to comply with the bill requirements
  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20
  8 11 days to cure the deficiency. Failure to comply within the 20
  8 12 days shall result, upon motion, in mandatory dismissal with

  7 14    The bill establishes a requirement for a certificate of
  7 15 merit affidavit for expert witnesses in medical malpractice
  7 16 cases. In an action for personal injury or wrongful death
  7 17 against a health care provider based upon alleged negligence
  7 18 in the practice of that profession or in patient care, the
  7 19 bill requires the plaintiff, within 90 days of the defendant's
  7 20 answer, to serve upon the defendant a certificate of merit
  7 21 affidavit for each expert witness who will testify with respect
  7 22 to the issues of standard of care, breach of standard of care,
  7 23 or causation.  A certificate of merit affidavit must be signed
  7 24 by the expert witness and certify the purpose for calling
  7 25 the expert witness by providing under the oath of the expert
  7 26 witness the expert witness's statement of familiarity with the
  7 27 applicable standard of care; statement that the standard of
  7 28 care was breached by the health care provider; statement of the
  7 29 actions that the health care provider failed to take or should
  7 30 have taken; and statement of the manner by which the breach of
  7 31 the standard of care was the cause of the injury.
  7 32    The bill provides that answers to interrogatories may
  7 33 serve as an expert witness's certificate of merit affidavit
  7 34 if the interrogatories satisfy the requirements of the bill.
  7 35 The bill provides that the expert witness's certificate of
  8  1 merit affidavit does not preclude additional discovery and
  8  2 supplementation of the expert witness's opinions.
  8  3    The bill provides that failure to substantially comply with
  8  4 the new requirements shall result, upon motion, in dismissal
  8  5 with prejudice of each cause of action as to which expert
  8  6 witness testimony is necessary to establish a prima facie
  8  7 case. A written notice of deficiency may be served upon the
  8  8 plaintiff for failure to comply with the bill requirements
  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20
  8 11 days to cure the deficiency. Failure to comply within the 20
  8 12 days shall result, upon motion, in mandatory dismissal with
  8 13 prejudice of each action as to which expert witness testimony
  8 14 is necessary to establish a prima facie case.
  8 15    EVIDENCE=BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES.  The bill
  8 16 defines "evidence=based medical practice guidelines" as
  8 17 voluntary medical practice parameters or protocols established
  8 18 and released through a recognized physician consensus=building
  8 19 organization.
  8 20    The bill provides that in any action for personal injury
  8 21 or wrongful death against a health care provider based
  8 22 upon the alleged negligence of the health care provider in
  8 23 patient care, the health care provider may establish as an
  8 24 affirmative defense that the health care provider complied with
  8 25 evidence=based medical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and
  8 26 treatment of the patient.
  8 27    The bill provides that the court shall admit evidence=based
  8 28 medical practice guidelines into evidence if introduced by a
  8 29 health care provider or the health care provider's employer
  8 30 and if the health care provider or the health care provider's
  8 31 employer submits evidence that the evidence=based medical
  8 32 practice guideline was appropriate for the patient and that
  8 33 the health care provider complied with such evidence=based
  8 34 medical practice guidelines. Evidence of departure from a
  8 35 guideline is admissible only on the issue of whether the health
  9  1 care provider is entitled to establish an affirmative defense
  9  2 under the bill. There shall be no presumption of negligence
  9  3 if a health care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based
  9  4 medical practice guideline.

  6 31    EXPERT WITNESSES IN MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CASES.  The
  6 32 bill provides standards for an expert witness in a medical
  6 33 malpractice case. The bill provides that a person is
  6 34 only qualified to serve as an expert witness in a medical
  6 35 malpractice case if the person is a licensed health care
  7  1 provider, is in good standing in each state of licensure, and
  7  2 in the five years preceding the act or omission alleged to
  7  3 be negligent, has not had a license in any state revoked or
  7  4 suspended; in the five years preceding the act or omission
  7  5 alleged to be negligent, actively practiced in the same field
  7  6 as the defendant or was a qualified instructor at an accredited

  7 14    The bill establishes a requirement for a certificate of
  7 15 merit affidavit for expert witnesses in medical malpractice
  7 16 cases. In an action for personal injury or wrongful death
  7 17 against a health care provider based upon alleged negligence
  7 18 in the practice of that profession or in patient care, the
  7 19 bill requires the plaintiff, within 90 days of the defendant's
  7 20 answer, to serve upon the defendant a certificate of merit
  7 21 affidavit for each expert witness who will testify with respect
  7 22 to the issues of standard of care, breach of standard of care,
  7 23 or causation.  A certificate of merit affidavit must be signed
  7 24 by the expert witness and certify the purpose for calling
  7 25 the expert witness by providing under the oath of the expert
  7 26 witness the expert witness's statement of familiarity with the
  7 27 applicable standard of care; statement that the standard of
  7 28 care was breached by the health care provider; statement of the
  7 29 actions that the health care provider failed to take or should
  7 30 have taken; and statement of the manner by which the breach of
  7 31 the standard of care was the cause of the injury.
  7 32    The bill provides that answers to interrogatories may
  7 33 serve as an expert witness's certificate of merit affidavit
  7 34 if the interrogatories satisfy the requirements of the bill.
  7 35 The bill provides that the expert witness's certificate of
  8  1 merit affidavit does not preclude additional discovery and
  8  2 supplementation of the expert witness's opinions.
  8  3    The bill provides that failure to substantially comply with
  8  4 the new requirements shall result, upon motion, in dismissal
  8  5 with prejudice of each cause of action as to which expert
  8  6 witness testimony is necessary to establish a prima facie
  8  7 case. A written notice of deficiency may be served upon the
  8  8 plaintiff for failure to comply with the bill requirements
  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20
  8 11 days to cure the deficiency. Failure to comply within the 20
  8 12 days shall result, upon motion, in mandatory dismissal with
  8 13 prejudice of each action as to which expert witness testimony
  8 14 is necessary to establish a prima facie case.
  8 15    EVIDENCE=BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES.  The bill
  8 16 defines "evidence=based medical practice guidelines" as
  8 17 voluntary medical practice parameters or protocols established
  8 18 and released through a recognized physician consensus=building
  8 19 organization.
  8 20    The bill provides that in any action for personal injury
  8 21 or wrongful death against a health care provider based
  8 22 upon the alleged negligence of the health care provider in
  8 23 patient care, the health care provider may establish as an
  8 24 affirmative defense that the health care provider complied with
  8 25 evidence=based medical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and
  8 26 treatment of the patient.
  8 27    The bill provides that the court shall admit evidence=based
  8 28 medical practice guidelines into evidence if introduced by a
  8 29 health care provider or the health care provider's employer
  8 30 and if the health care provider or the health care provider's
  8 31 employer submits evidence that the evidence=based medical
  8 32 practice guideline was appropriate for the patient and that
  8 33 the health care provider complied with such evidence=based
  8 34 medical practice guidelines. Evidence of departure from a
  8 35 guideline is admissible only on the issue of whether the health
  9  1 care provider is entitled to establish an affirmative defense
  9  2 under the bill. There shall be no presumption of negligence
  9  3 if a health care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based
  9  4 medical practice guideline.

  6 31    EXPERT WITNESSES IN MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CASES.  The
  6 32 bill provides standards for an expert witness in a medical
  6 33 malpractice case. The bill provides that a person is
  6 34 only qualified to serve as an expert witness in a medical
  6 35 malpractice case if the person is a licensed health care
  7  1 provider, is in good standing in each state of licensure, and
  7  2 in the five years preceding the act or omission alleged to
  7  3 be negligent, has not had a license in any state revoked or
  7  4 suspended; in the five years preceding the act or omission
  7  5 alleged to be negligent, actively practiced in the same field
  7  6 as the defendant or was a qualified instructor at an accredited

  7 13 in a specialty, the person is certified in the same specialty.
  7 14    The bill establishes a requirement for a certificate of
  7 15 merit affidavit for expert witnesses in medical malpractice

  7 18 in the practice of that profession or in patient care, the
  7 19 bill requires the plaintiff, within 90 days of the defendant's
  7 20 answer, to serve upon the defendant a certificate of merit
  7 21 affidavit for each expert witness who will testify with respect
  7 22 to the issues of standard of care, breach of standard of care,
  7 23 or causation.  A certificate of merit affidavit must be signed
  7 24 by the expert witness and certify the purpose for calling
  7 25 the expert witness by providing under the oath of the expert
  7 26 witness the expert witness's statement of familiarity with the
  7 27 applicable standard of care; statement that the standard of
  7 28 care was breached by the health care provider; statement of the
  7 29 actions that the health care provider failed to take or should
  7 30 have taken; and statement of the manner by which the breach of
  7 31 the standard of care was the cause of the injury.
  7 32    The bill provides that answers to interrogatories may
  7 33 serve as an expert witness's certificate of merit affidavit
  7 34 if the interrogatories satisfy the requirements of the bill.
  7 35 The bill provides that the expert witness's certificate of
  8  1 merit affidavit does not preclude additional discovery and
  8  2 supplementation of the expert witness's opinions.
  8  3    The bill provides that failure to substantially comply with
  8  4 the new requirements shall result, upon motion, in dismissal
  8  5 with prejudice of each cause of action as to which expert
  8  6 witness testimony is necessary to establish a prima facie
  8  7 case. A written notice of deficiency may be served upon the
  8  8 plaintiff for failure to comply with the bill requirements
  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20
  8 11 days to cure the deficiency. Failure to comply within the 20
  8 12 days shall result, upon motion, in mandatory dismissal with
  8 13 prejudice of each action as to which expert witness testimony
  8 14 is necessary to establish a prima facie case.
  8 15    EVIDENCE=BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES.  The bill
  8 16 defines "evidence=based medical practice guidelines" as
  8 17 voluntary medical practice parameters or protocols established
  8 18 and released through a recognized physician consensus=building
  8 19 organization.
  8 20    The bill provides that in any action for personal injury
  8 21 or wrongful death against a health care provider based
  8 22 upon the alleged negligence of the health care provider in
  8 23 patient care, the health care provider may establish as an
  8 24 affirmative defense that the health care provider complied with
  8 25 evidence=based medical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and
  8 26 treatment of the patient.
  8 27    The bill provides that the court shall admit evidence=based
  8 28 medical practice guidelines into evidence if introduced by a
  8 29 health care provider or the health care provider's employer
  8 30 and if the health care provider or the health care provider's
  8 31 employer submits evidence that the evidence=based medical
  8 32 practice guideline was appropriate for the patient and that
  8 33 the health care provider complied with such evidence=based
  8 34 medical practice guidelines. Evidence of departure from a
  8 35 guideline is admissible only on the issue of whether the health
  9  1 care provider is entitled to establish an affirmative defense
  9  2 under the bill. There shall be no presumption of negligence
  9  3 if a health care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based
  9  4 medical practice guideline.

  5 24    b.  The health care provider's failure to properly follow
  5 25 an evidence=based medical practice guideline where such
  5 26 failure was caused by the health care provider's negligence or

  5 35 expert witnesses and defenses.
  6  1 ADVERSE HEALTH CARE INCIDENTS.  Under Code chapter 135P, if
  6  2 an adverse health care incident occurs, a health care provider
  6  3 may offer to engage in an open discussion with the patient. If
  6  4 the patient agrees, the health care provider may investigate
  6  5 the incident, disclose the results to the patient, and discuss
  6  6 steps the health care provider will take to prevent similar
  6  7 incidents. The health care provider may also communicate to
  6  8 the patient whether the health care provider believes that
  6  9 an offer of compensation is warranted. All communications
  6 10 made related to the open discussion are privileged and
  6 11 confidential, are not subject to discovery or subpoena, and
  6 12 are not admissible in evidence in a judicial, administrative,
  6 13 or arbitration proceeding. Under current Code chapter 135P,
  6 14 "health care provider" is defined as a physician licensed under
  6 15 Code chapter 148, a physician assistant licensed under Code
  6 16 chapter 148C, a podiatrist licensed under Code chapter 149, or
  6 17 an advanced registered nurse practitioner licensed pursuant
  6 18 to Code chapter 152 or 152E.  The bill redefines "health
  6 19 care provider" to mean a physician or osteopathic physician
  6 20 licensed under chapter 148, a physician assistant licensed  and
  6 21 practicing under a supervising physician pursuant to chapter
  6 22 148C, a podiatrist licensed under chapter 149, a chiropractor
  6 23 licensed under chapter 151, a licensed practical nurse, a

  6 27 pharmacist licensed under chapter 155A, or any other person who
  6 28 is licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized or permitted by
  6 29 the law of this state to administer health care in the ordinary
  6 30 course of business or in the practice of a profession.
  6 31    EXPERT WITNESSES IN MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CASES.  The
  6 32 bill provides standards for an expert witness in a medical
  6 33 malpractice case. The bill provides that a person is
  6 34 only qualified to serve as an expert witness in a medical
  6 35 malpractice case if the person is a licensed health care
  7  1 provider, is in good standing in each state of licensure, and
  7  2 in the five years preceding the act or omission alleged to
  7  3 be negligent, has not had a license in any state revoked or
  7  4 suspended; in the five years preceding the act or omission
  7  5 alleged to be negligent, actively practiced in the same field
  7  6 as the defendant or was a qualified instructor at an accredited
  7  7 university in the same field as the defendant; practiced or
  7  8 provided instruction in the same or substantially similar
  7  9 specialty as the defendant; is trained and experienced in the
  7 10 same discipline or school of practice as the defendant or
  7 11 has specialty expertise in the disease process or procedure
  7 12 performed in the case; and, if the defendant is board=certified
  7 13 in a specialty, the person is certified in the same specialty.
  7 14    The bill establishes a requirement for a certificate of
  7 15 merit affidavit for expert witnesses in medical malpractice
  7 16 cases. In an action for personal injury or wrongful death
  7 17 against a health care provider based upon alleged negligence
  7 18 in the practice of that profession or in patient care, the
  7 19 bill requires the plaintiff, within 90 days of the defendant's
  7 20 answer, to serve upon the defendant a certificate of merit
  7 21 affidavit for each expert witness who will testify with respect
  7 22 to the issues of standard of care, breach of standard of care,
  7 23 or causation.  A certificate of merit affidavit must be signed
  7 24 by the expert witness and certify the purpose for calling
  7 25 the expert witness by providing under the oath of the expert
  7 26 witness the expert witness's statement of familiarity with the
  7 27 applicable standard of care; statement that the standard of
  7 28 care was breached by the health care provider; statement of the
  7 29 actions that the health care provider failed to take or should
  7 30 have taken; and statement of the manner by which the breach of
  7 31 the standard of care was the cause of the injury.
  7 32    The bill provides that answers to interrogatories may
  7 33 serve as an expert witness's certificate of merit affidavit
  7 34 if the interrogatories satisfy the requirements of the bill.
  7 35 The bill provides that the expert witness's certificate of
  8  1 merit affidavit does not preclude additional discovery and
  8  2 supplementation of the expert witness's opinions.
  8  3    The bill provides that failure to substantially comply with
  8  4 the new requirements shall result, upon motion, in dismissal
  8  5 with prejudice of each cause of action as to which expert
  8  6 witness testimony is necessary to establish a prima facie
  8  7 case. A written notice of deficiency may be served upon the
  8  8 plaintiff for failure to comply with the bill requirements
  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20
  8 11 days to cure the deficiency. Failure to comply within the 20
  8 12 days shall result, upon motion, in mandatory dismissal with
  8 13 prejudice of each action as to which expert witness testimony
  8 14 is necessary to establish a prima facie case.
  8 15    EVIDENCE=BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES.  The bill
  8 16 defines "evidence=based medical practice guidelines" as
  8 17 voluntary medical practice parameters or protocols established
  8 18 and released through a recognized physician consensus=building
  8 19 organization.
  8 20    The bill provides that in any action for personal injury
  8 21 or wrongful death against a health care provider based
  8 22 upon the alleged negligence of the health care provider in
  8 23 patient care, the health care provider may establish as an
  8 24 affirmative defense that the health care provider complied with
  8 25 evidence=based medical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and
  8 26 treatment of the patient.
  8 27    The bill provides that the court shall admit evidence=based
  8 28 medical practice guidelines into evidence if introduced by a
  8 29 health care provider or the health care provider's employer
  8 30 and if the health care provider or the health care provider's
  8 31 employer submits evidence that the evidence=based medical
  8 32 practice guideline was appropriate for the patient and that
  8 33 the health care provider complied with such evidence=based
  8 34 medical practice guidelines. Evidence of departure from a
  8 35 guideline is admissible only on the issue of whether the health
  9  1 care provider is entitled to establish an affirmative defense
  9  2 under the bill. There shall be no presumption of negligence
  9  3 if a health care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based
  9  4 medical practice guideline.

  5  4 in patient care, the health care provider may establish as an
  5  5 affirmative defense that the health care provider complied with
  5  6 evidence=based medical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and
  5  7 treatment of the patient.
  5  8    3.  The court shall admit evidence=based medical practice
  5  9 guidelines into evidence if introduced by a health care
  5 10 provider or the health care provider's employer and if the
  5 11 health care provider or the health care provider's employer
  5 12 submits evidence that the evidence=based medical practice
  5 13 guidelines were appropriate for the patient and that the
  5 14 health care provider complied with such evidence=based
  5 15 medical practice guidelines. Evidence of departure from an
  5 16 evidence=based medical practice guideline is admissible only on
  5 17 the issue of whether the health care provider is entitled to
  5 18 establish an affirmative defense under this section.
  5 19    4.  This section shall not apply to any of the following:
  5 20    a.  The health care provider's mistaken determination that
  5 21 an evidence=based medical practice guideline applied to a
  5 22 particular patient where such mistake was caused by the health
  5 23 care provider's negligence or intentional misconduct.
  5 24    b.  The health care provider's failure to properly follow
  5 25 an evidence=based medical practice guideline where such
  5 26 failure was caused by the health care provider's negligence or
  5 27 intentional misconduct.
  5 28    5.  There shall be no presumption of negligence if a health
  5 29 care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based medical
  5 30 practice guideline.

  5 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 34    This bill relates to medical malpractice claims, including
  5 35 expert witnesses and defenses.
  6  1 ADVERSE HEALTH CARE INCIDENTS.  Under Code chapter 135P, if
  6  2 an adverse health care incident occurs, a health care provider
  6  3 may offer to engage in an open discussion with the patient. If
  6  4 the patient agrees, the health care provider may investigate
  6  5 the incident, disclose the results to the patient, and discuss
  6  6 steps the health care provider will take to prevent similar
  6  7 incidents. The health care provider may also communicate to
  6  8 the patient whether the health care provider believes that
  6  9 an offer of compensation is warranted. All communications
  6 10 made related to the open discussion are privileged and
  6 11 confidential, are not subject to discovery or subpoena, and
  6 12 are not admissible in evidence in a judicial, administrative,
  6 13 or arbitration proceeding. Under current Code chapter 135P,
  6 14 "health care provider" is defined as a physician licensed under
  6 15 Code chapter 148, a physician assistant licensed under Code
  6 16 chapter 148C, a podiatrist licensed under Code chapter 149, or
  6 17 an advanced registered nurse practitioner licensed pursuant
  6 18 to Code chapter 152 or 152E.  The bill redefines "health
  6 19 care provider" to mean a physician or osteopathic physician
  6 20 licensed under chapter 148, a physician assistant licensed  and
  6 21 practicing under a supervising physician pursuant to chapter
  6 22 148C, a podiatrist licensed under chapter 149, a chiropractor
  6 23 licensed under chapter 151, a licensed practical nurse, a

  6 26 chapter 153, an optometrist licensed under chapter 154, a
  6 27 pharmacist licensed under chapter 155A, or any other person who
  6 28 is licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized or permitted by
  6 29 the law of this state to administer health care in the ordinary
  6 30 course of business or in the practice of a profession.
  6 31    EXPERT WITNESSES IN MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CASES.  The
  6 32 bill provides standards for an expert witness in a medical
  6 33 malpractice case. The bill provides that a person is
  6 34 only qualified to serve as an expert witness in a medical
  6 35 malpractice case if the person is a licensed health care
  7  1 provider, is in good standing in each state of licensure, and
  7  2 in the five years preceding the act or omission alleged to
  7  3 be negligent, has not had a license in any state revoked or
  7  4 suspended; in the five years preceding the act or omission
  7  5 alleged to be negligent, actively practiced in the same field
  7  6 as the defendant or was a qualified instructor at an accredited
  7  7 university in the same field as the defendant; practiced or
  7  8 provided instruction in the same or substantially similar
  7  9 specialty as the defendant; is trained and experienced in the
  7 10 same discipline or school of practice as the defendant or
  7 11 has specialty expertise in the disease process or procedure
  7 12 performed in the case; and, if the defendant is board=certified
  7 13 in a specialty, the person is certified in the same specialty.
  7 14    The bill establishes a requirement for a certificate of
  7 15 merit affidavit for expert witnesses in medical malpractice
  7 16 cases. In an action for personal injury or wrongful death
  7 17 against a health care provider based upon alleged negligence
  7 18 in the practice of that profession or in patient care, the
  7 19 bill requires the plaintiff, within 90 days of the defendant's
  7 20 answer, to serve upon the defendant a certificate of merit
  7 21 affidavit for each expert witness who will testify with respect
  7 22 to the issues of standard of care, breach of standard of care,
  7 23 or causation.  A certificate of merit affidavit must be signed
  7 24 by the expert witness and certify the purpose for calling
  7 25 the expert witness by providing under the oath of the expert
  7 26 witness the expert witness's statement of familiarity with the
  7 27 applicable standard of care; statement that the standard of
  7 28 care was breached by the health care provider; statement of the
  7 29 actions that the health care provider failed to take or should
  7 30 have taken; and statement of the manner by which the breach of
  7 31 the standard of care was the cause of the injury.
  7 32    The bill provides that answers to interrogatories may
  7 33 serve as an expert witness's certificate of merit affidavit
  7 34 if the interrogatories satisfy the requirements of the bill.
  7 35 The bill provides that the expert witness's certificate of
  8  1 merit affidavit does not preclude additional discovery and
  8  2 supplementation of the expert witness's opinions.
  8  3    The bill provides that failure to substantially comply with
  8  4 the new requirements shall result, upon motion, in dismissal
  8  5 with prejudice of each cause of action as to which expert
  8  6 witness testimony is necessary to establish a prima facie
  8  7 case. A written notice of deficiency may be served upon the
  8  8 plaintiff for failure to comply with the bill requirements
  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20
  8 11 days to cure the deficiency. Failure to comply within the 20
  8 12 days shall result, upon motion, in mandatory dismissal with
  8 13 prejudice of each action as to which expert witness testimony
  8 14 is necessary to establish a prima facie case.
  8 15    EVIDENCE=BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES.  The bill
  8 16 defines "evidence=based medical practice guidelines" as
  8 17 voluntary medical practice parameters or protocols established
  8 18 and released through a recognized physician consensus=building
  8 19 organization.
  8 20    The bill provides that in any action for personal injury
  8 21 or wrongful death against a health care provider based
  8 22 upon the alleged negligence of the health care provider in
  8 23 patient care, the health care provider may establish as an
  8 24 affirmative defense that the health care provider complied with
  8 25 evidence=based medical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and
  8 26 treatment of the patient.
  8 27    The bill provides that the court shall admit evidence=based
  8 28 medical practice guidelines into evidence if introduced by a
  8 29 health care provider or the health care provider's employer
  8 30 and if the health care provider or the health care provider's
  8 31 employer submits evidence that the evidence=based medical
  8 32 practice guideline was appropriate for the patient and that
  8 33 the health care provider complied with such evidence=based
  8 34 medical practice guidelines. Evidence of departure from a
  8 35 guideline is admissible only on the issue of whether the health
  9  1 care provider is entitled to establish an affirmative defense
  9  2 under the bill. There shall be no presumption of negligence
  9  3 if a health care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based
  9  4 medical practice guideline.

  5  9 guidelines into evidence if introduced by a health care
  5 10 provider or the health care provider's employer and if the

  5 12 submits evidence that the evidence=based medical practice
  5 13 guidelines were appropriate for the patient and that the
  5 14 health care provider complied with such evidence=based
  5 15 medical practice guidelines. Evidence of departure from an
  5 16 evidence=based medical practice guideline is admissible only on
  5 17 the issue of whether the health care provider is entitled to
  5 18 establish an affirmative defense under this section.
  5 19    4.  This section shall not apply to any of the following:
  5 20    a.  The health care provider's mistaken determination that
  5 21 an evidence=based medical practice guideline applied to a
  5 22 particular patient where such mistake was caused by the health
  5 23 care provider's negligence or intentional misconduct.
  5 24    b.  The health care provider's failure to properly follow
  5 25 an evidence=based medical practice guideline where such
  5 26 failure was caused by the health care provider's negligence or
  5 27 intentional misconduct.
  5 28    5.  There shall be no presumption of negligence if a health
  5 29 care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based medical
  5 30 practice guideline.

  6  4 the patient agrees, the health care provider may investigate
  6  5 the incident, disclose the results to the patient, and discuss
  6  6 steps the health care provider will take to prevent similar
  6  7 incidents. The health care provider may also communicate to

  6  9 an offer of compensation is warranted. All communications
  6 10 made related to the open discussion are privileged and
  6 11 confidential, are not subject to discovery or subpoena, and
  6 12 are not admissible in evidence in a judicial, administrative,
  6 13 or arbitration proceeding. Under current Code chapter 135P,

  6 15 Code chapter 148, a physician assistant licensed under Code
  6 16 chapter 148C, a podiatrist licensed under Code chapter 149, or

  6 31    EXPERT WITNESSES IN MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CASES.  The
  6 32 bill provides standards for an expert witness in a medical
  6 33 malpractice case. The bill provides that a person is
  6 34 only qualified to serve as an expert witness in a medical
  6 35 malpractice case if the person is a licensed health care
  7  1 provider, is in good standing in each state of licensure, and
  7  2 in the five years preceding the act or omission alleged to
  7  3 be negligent, has not had a license in any state revoked or
  7  4 suspended; in the five years preceding the act or omission
  7  5 alleged to be negligent, actively practiced in the same field
  7  6 as the defendant or was a qualified instructor at an accredited
  7  7 university in the same field as the defendant; practiced or
  7  8 provided instruction in the same or substantially similar

  7 13 in a specialty, the person is certified in the same specialty.
  7 14    The bill establishes a requirement for a certificate of
  7 15 merit affidavit for expert witnesses in medical malpractice
  7 16 cases. In an action for personal injury or wrongful death
  7 17 against a health care provider based upon alleged negligence
  7 18 in the practice of that profession or in patient care, the
  7 19 bill requires the plaintiff, within 90 days of the defendant's
  7 20 answer, to serve upon the defendant a certificate of merit
  7 21 affidavit for each expert witness who will testify with respect
  7 22 to the issues of standard of care, breach of standard of care,
  7 23 or causation.  A certificate of merit affidavit must be signed
  7 24 by the expert witness and certify the purpose for calling
  7 25 the expert witness by providing under the oath of the expert
  7 26 witness the expert witness's statement of familiarity with the
  7 27 applicable standard of care; statement that the standard of
  7 28 care was breached by the health care provider; statement of the
  7 29 actions that the health care provider failed to take or should
  7 30 have taken; and statement of the manner by which the breach of
  7 31 the standard of care was the cause of the injury.
  7 32    The bill provides that answers to interrogatories may
  7 33 serve as an expert witness's certificate of merit affidavit
  7 34 if the interrogatories satisfy the requirements of the bill.
  7 35 The bill provides that the expert witness's certificate of
  8  1 merit affidavit does not preclude additional discovery and
  8  2 supplementation of the expert witness's opinions.
  8  3    The bill provides that failure to substantially comply with
  8  4 the new requirements shall result, upon motion, in dismissal
  8  5 with prejudice of each cause of action as to which expert
  8  6 witness testimony is necessary to establish a prima facie
  8  7 case. A written notice of deficiency may be served upon the
  8  8 plaintiff for failure to comply with the bill requirements
  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20
  8 11 days to cure the deficiency. Failure to comply within the 20
  8 12 days shall result, upon motion, in mandatory dismissal with
  8 13 prejudice of each action as to which expert witness testimony
  8 14 is necessary to establish a prima facie case.
  8 15    EVIDENCE=BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES.  The bill
  8 16 defines "evidence=based medical practice guidelines" as
  8 17 voluntary medical practice parameters or protocols established
  8 18 and released through a recognized physician consensus=building
  8 19 organization.
  8 20    The bill provides that in any action for personal injury
  8 21 or wrongful death against a health care provider based
  8 22 upon the alleged negligence of the health care provider in
  8 23 patient care, the health care provider may establish as an
  8 24 affirmative defense that the health care provider complied with
  8 25 evidence=based medical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and
  8 26 treatment of the patient.
  8 27    The bill provides that the court shall admit evidence=based
  8 28 medical practice guidelines into evidence if introduced by a
  8 29 health care provider or the health care provider's employer
  8 30 and if the health care provider or the health care provider's
  8 31 employer submits evidence that the evidence=based medical
  8 32 practice guideline was appropriate for the patient and that
  8 33 the health care provider complied with such evidence=based
  8 34 medical practice guidelines. Evidence of departure from a
  8 35 guideline is admissible only on the issue of whether the health
  9  1 care provider is entitled to establish an affirmative defense
  9  2 under the bill. There shall be no presumption of negligence
  9  3 if a health care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based
  9  4 medical practice guideline.

  5 23 care provider's negligence or intentional misconduct.
  5 24    b.  The health care provider's failure to properly follow
  5 25 an evidence=based medical practice guideline where such

  7  1 provider, is in good standing in each state of licensure, and
  7  2 in the five years preceding the act or omission alleged to
  7  3 be negligent, has not had a license in any state revoked or
  7  4 suspended; in the five years preceding the act or omission

  7 28 care was breached by the health care provider; statement of the
  7 29 actions that the health care provider failed to take or should

  8  4 the new requirements shall result, upon motion, in dismissal
  8  5 with prejudice of each cause of action as to which expert
  8  6 witness testimony is necessary to establish a prima facie
  8  7 case. A written notice of deficiency may be served upon the
  8  8 plaintiff for failure to comply with the bill requirements
  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20
  8 11 days to cure the deficiency. Failure to comply within the 20
  8 12 days shall result, upon motion, in mandatory dismissal with

  8 21 or wrongful death against a health care provider based
  8 22 upon the alleged negligence of the health care provider in
  8 23 patient care, the health care provider may establish as an
  8 24 affirmative defense that the health care provider complied with
  8 25 evidence=based medical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and
  8 26 treatment of the patient.
  8 27    The bill provides that the court shall admit evidence=based
  8 28 medical practice guidelines into evidence if introduced by a
  8 29 health care provider or the health care provider's employer
  8 30 and if the health care provider or the health care provider's
  8 31 employer submits evidence that the evidence=based medical
  8 32 practice guideline was appropriate for the patient and that
  8 33 the health care provider complied with such evidence=based
  8 34 medical practice guidelines. Evidence of departure from a
  8 35 guideline is admissible only on the issue of whether the health
  9  1 care provider is entitled to establish an affirmative defense
  9  2 under the bill. There shall be no presumption of negligence
  9  3 if a health care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based
  9  4 medical practice guideline.

  7 33 serve as an expert witness's certificate of merit affidavit
  7 34 if the interrogatories satisfy the requirements of the bill.
  7 35 The bill provides that the expert witness's certificate of
  8  1 merit affidavit does not preclude additional discovery and
  8  2 supplementation of the expert witness's opinions.
  8  3    The bill provides that failure to substantially comply with
  8  4 the new requirements shall result, upon motion, in dismissal
  8  5 with prejudice of each cause of action as to which expert
  8  6 witness testimony is necessary to establish a prima facie
  8  7 case. A written notice of deficiency may be served upon the
  8  8 plaintiff for failure to comply with the bill requirements
  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20
  8 11 days to cure the deficiency. Failure to comply within the 20
  8 12 days shall result, upon motion, in mandatory dismissal with

  8 20    The bill provides that in any action for personal injury
  8 21 or wrongful death against a health care provider based
  8 22 upon the alleged negligence of the health care provider in
  8 23 patient care, the health care provider may establish as an
  8 24 affirmative defense that the health care provider complied with
  8 25 evidence=based medical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and
  8 26 treatment of the patient.
  8 27    The bill provides that the court shall admit evidence=based
  8 28 medical practice guidelines into evidence if introduced by a
  8 29 health care provider or the health care provider's employer
  8 30 and if the health care provider or the health care provider's
  8 31 employer submits evidence that the evidence=based medical
  8 32 practice guideline was appropriate for the patient and that
  8 33 the health care provider complied with such evidence=based
  8 34 medical practice guidelines. Evidence of departure from a
  8 35 guideline is admissible only on the issue of whether the health
  9  1 care provider is entitled to establish an affirmative defense
  9  2 under the bill. There shall be no presumption of negligence
  9  3 if a health care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based
  9  4 medical practice guideline.

  8 19 organization.
  8 20    The bill provides that in any action for personal injury
  8 21 or wrongful death against a health care provider based
  8 22 upon the alleged negligence of the health care provider in
  8 23 patient care, the health care provider may establish as an
  8 24 affirmative defense that the health care provider complied with
  8 25 evidence=based medical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and
  8 26 treatment of the patient.
  8 27    The bill provides that the court shall admit evidence=based
  8 28 medical practice guidelines into evidence if introduced by a

  8 30 and if the health care provider or the health care provider's
  8 31 employer submits evidence that the evidence=based medical
  8 32 practice guideline was appropriate for the patient and that
  8 33 the health care provider complied with such evidence=based
  8 34 medical practice guidelines. Evidence of departure from a
  8 35 guideline is admissible only on the issue of whether the health
  9  1 care provider is entitled to establish an affirmative defense
  9  2 under the bill. There shall be no presumption of negligence
  9  3 if a health care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based
  9  4 medical practice guideline.

  5 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 34    This bill relates to medical malpractice claims, including
  5 35 expert witnesses and defenses.
  6  1 ADVERSE HEALTH CARE INCIDENTS.  Under Code chapter 135P, if
  6  2 an adverse health care incident occurs, a health care provider
  6  3 may offer to engage in an open discussion with the patient. If
  6  4 the patient agrees, the health care provider may investigate
  6  5 the incident, disclose the results to the patient, and discuss
  6  6 steps the health care provider will take to prevent similar
  6  7 incidents. The health care provider may also communicate to
  6  8 the patient whether the health care provider believes that
  6  9 an offer of compensation is warranted. All communications
  6 10 made related to the open discussion are privileged and
  6 11 confidential, are not subject to discovery or subpoena, and
  6 12 are not admissible in evidence in a judicial, administrative,
  6 13 or arbitration proceeding. Under current Code chapter 135P,
  6 14 "health care provider" is defined as a physician licensed under
  6 15 Code chapter 148, a physician assistant licensed under Code
  6 16 chapter 148C, a podiatrist licensed under Code chapter 149, or
  6 17 an advanced registered nurse practitioner licensed pursuant

  6 19 care provider" to mean a physician or osteopathic physician
  6 20 licensed under chapter 148, a physician assistant licensed  and
  6 21 practicing under a supervising physician pursuant to chapter

  6 30 course of business or in the practice of a profession.
  6 31    EXPERT WITNESSES IN MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CASES.  The
  6 32 bill provides standards for an expert witness in a medical
  6 33 malpractice case. The bill provides that a person is
  6 34 only qualified to serve as an expert witness in a medical
  6 35 malpractice case if the person is a licensed health care
  7  1 provider, is in good standing in each state of licensure, and
  7  2 in the five years preceding the act or omission alleged to
  7  3 be negligent, has not had a license in any state revoked or
  7  4 suspended; in the five years preceding the act or omission
  7  5 alleged to be negligent, actively practiced in the same field
  7  6 as the defendant or was a qualified instructor at an accredited
  7  7 university in the same field as the defendant; practiced or
  7  8 provided instruction in the same or substantially similar
  7  9 specialty as the defendant; is trained and experienced in the

  7 12 performed in the case; and, if the defendant is board=certified
  7 13 in a specialty, the person is certified in the same specialty.
  7 14    The bill establishes a requirement for a certificate of
  7 15 merit affidavit for expert witnesses in medical malpractice
  7 16 cases. In an action for personal injury or wrongful death
  7 17 against a health care provider based upon alleged negligence
  7 18 in the practice of that profession or in patient care, the
  7 19 bill requires the plaintiff, within 90 days of the defendant's
  7 20 answer, to serve upon the defendant a certificate of merit
  7 21 affidavit for each expert witness who will testify with respect
  7 22 to the issues of standard of care, breach of standard of care,
  7 23 or causation.  A certificate of merit affidavit must be signed
  7 24 by the expert witness and certify the purpose for calling
  7 25 the expert witness by providing under the oath of the expert
  7 26 witness the expert witness's statement of familiarity with the
  7 27 applicable standard of care; statement that the standard of
  7 28 care was breached by the health care provider; statement of the
  7 29 actions that the health care provider failed to take or should
  7 30 have taken; and statement of the manner by which the breach of
  7 31 the standard of care was the cause of the injury.
  7 32    The bill provides that answers to interrogatories may
  7 33 serve as an expert witness's certificate of merit affidavit
  7 34 if the interrogatories satisfy the requirements of the bill.
  7 35 The bill provides that the expert witness's certificate of
  8  1 merit affidavit does not preclude additional discovery and
  8  2 supplementation of the expert witness's opinions.
  8  3    The bill provides that failure to substantially comply with
  8  4 the new requirements shall result, upon motion, in dismissal
  8  5 with prejudice of each cause of action as to which expert
  8  6 witness testimony is necessary to establish a prima facie
  8  7 case. A written notice of deficiency may be served upon the
  8  8 plaintiff for failure to comply with the bill requirements
  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20
  8 11 days to cure the deficiency. Failure to comply within the 20
  8 12 days shall result, upon motion, in mandatory dismissal with
  8 13 prejudice of each action as to which expert witness testimony
  8 14 is necessary to establish a prima facie case.

  8 27    The bill provides that the court shall admit evidence=based
  8 28 medical practice guidelines into evidence if introduced by a
  8 29 health care provider or the health care provider's employer
  8 30 and if the health care provider or the health care provider's
  8 31 employer submits evidence that the evidence=based medical
  8 32 practice guideline was appropriate for the patient and that
  8 33 the health care provider complied with such evidence=based
  8 34 medical practice guidelines. Evidence of departure from a
  8 35 guideline is admissible only on the issue of whether the health
  9  1 care provider is entitled to establish an affirmative defense
  9  2 under the bill. There shall be no presumption of negligence
  9  3 if a health care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based

  6 31    EXPERT WITNESSES IN MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CASES.  The
  6 32 bill provides standards for an expert witness in a medical
  6 33 malpractice case. The bill provides that a person is

  6 35 malpractice case if the person is a licensed health care
  7  1 provider, is in good standing in each state of licensure, and

  5 34    This bill relates to medical malpractice claims, including
  5 35 expert witnesses and defenses.
  6  1 ADVERSE HEALTH CARE INCIDENTS.  Under Code chapter 135P, if
  6  2 an adverse health care incident occurs, a health care provider
  6  3 may offer to engage in an open discussion with the patient. If
  6  4 the patient agrees, the health care provider may investigate
  6  5 the incident, disclose the results to the patient, and discuss
  6  6 steps the health care provider will take to prevent similar
  6  7 incidents. The health care provider may also communicate to
  6  8 the patient whether the health care provider believes that
  6  9 an offer of compensation is warranted. All communications
  6 10 made related to the open discussion are privileged and
  6 11 confidential, are not subject to discovery or subpoena, and
  6 12 are not admissible in evidence in a judicial, administrative,
  6 13 or arbitration proceeding. Under current Code chapter 135P,
  6 14 "health care provider" is defined as a physician licensed under
  6 15 Code chapter 148, a physician assistant licensed under Code
  6 16 chapter 148C, a podiatrist licensed under Code chapter 149, or
  6 17 an advanced registered nurse practitioner licensed pursuant
  6 18 to Code chapter 152 or 152E.  The bill redefines "health
  6 19 care provider" to mean a physician or osteopathic physician
  6 20 licensed under chapter 148, a physician assistant licensed  and
  6 21 practicing under a supervising physician pursuant to chapter
  6 22 148C, a podiatrist licensed under chapter 149, a chiropractor
  6 23 licensed under chapter 151, a licensed practical nurse, a
  6 24 registered nurse, or an advanced registered nurse practitioner

  6 26 chapter 153, an optometrist licensed under chapter 154, a
  6 27 pharmacist licensed under chapter 155A, or any other person who
  6 28 is licensed, certified, or otherwise authorized or permitted by
  6 29 the law of this state to administer health care in the ordinary
  6 30 course of business or in the practice of a profession.
  6 31    EXPERT WITNESSES IN MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CASES.  The
  6 32 bill provides standards for an expert witness in a medical
  6 33 malpractice case. The bill provides that a person is
  6 34 only qualified to serve as an expert witness in a medical
  6 35 malpractice case if the person is a licensed health care
  7  1 provider, is in good standing in each state of licensure, and
  7  2 in the five years preceding the act or omission alleged to
  7  3 be negligent, has not had a license in any state revoked or
  7  4 suspended; in the five years preceding the act or omission
  7  5 alleged to be negligent, actively practiced in the same field
  7  6 as the defendant or was a qualified instructor at an accredited
  7  7 university in the same field as the defendant; practiced or
  7  8 provided instruction in the same or substantially similar
  7  9 specialty as the defendant; is trained and experienced in the
  7 10 same discipline or school of practice as the defendant or
  7 11 has specialty expertise in the disease process or procedure
  7 12 performed in the case; and, if the defendant is board=certified
  7 13 in a specialty, the person is certified in the same specialty.
  7 14    The bill establishes a requirement for a certificate of
  7 15 merit affidavit for expert witnesses in medical malpractice
  7 16 cases. In an action for personal injury or wrongful death
  7 17 against a health care provider based upon alleged negligence
  7 18 in the practice of that profession or in patient care, the
  7 19 bill requires the plaintiff, within 90 days of the defendant's
  7 20 answer, to serve upon the defendant a certificate of merit
  7 21 affidavit for each expert witness who will testify with respect
  7 22 to the issues of standard of care, breach of standard of care,
  7 23 or causation.  A certificate of merit affidavit must be signed
  7 24 by the expert witness and certify the purpose for calling
  7 25 the expert witness by providing under the oath of the expert
  7 26 witness the expert witness's statement of familiarity with the
  7 27 applicable standard of care; statement that the standard of
  7 28 care was breached by the health care provider; statement of the
  7 29 actions that the health care provider failed to take or should
  7 30 have taken; and statement of the manner by which the breach of
  7 31 the standard of care was the cause of the injury.
  7 32    The bill provides that answers to interrogatories may
  7 33 serve as an expert witness's certificate of merit affidavit
  7 34 if the interrogatories satisfy the requirements of the bill.
  7 35 The bill provides that the expert witness's certificate of
  8  1 merit affidavit does not preclude additional discovery and
  8  2 supplementation of the expert witness's opinions.
  8  3    The bill provides that failure to substantially comply with
  8  4 the new requirements shall result, upon motion, in dismissal
  8  5 with prejudice of each cause of action as to which expert
  8  6 witness testimony is necessary to establish a prima facie
  8  7 case. A written notice of deficiency may be served upon the
  8  8 plaintiff for failure to comply with the bill requirements
  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20
  8 11 days to cure the deficiency. Failure to comply within the 20
  8 12 days shall result, upon motion, in mandatory dismissal with
  8 13 prejudice of each action as to which expert witness testimony
  8 14 is necessary to establish a prima facie case.
  8 15    EVIDENCE=BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES.  The bill
  8 16 defines "evidence=based medical practice guidelines" as
  8 17 voluntary medical practice parameters or protocols established
  8 18 and released through a recognized physician consensus=building
  8 19 organization.
  8 20    The bill provides that in any action for personal injury
  8 21 or wrongful death against a health care provider based
  8 22 upon the alleged negligence of the health care provider in
  8 23 patient care, the health care provider may establish as an
  8 24 affirmative defense that the health care provider complied with
  8 25 evidence=based medical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and
  8 26 treatment of the patient.
  8 27    The bill provides that the court shall admit evidence=based
  8 28 medical practice guidelines into evidence if introduced by a
  8 29 health care provider or the health care provider's employer
  8 30 and if the health care provider or the health care provider's
  8 31 employer submits evidence that the evidence=based medical
  8 32 practice guideline was appropriate for the patient and that
  8 33 the health care provider complied with such evidence=based
  8 34 medical practice guidelines. Evidence of departure from a
  8 35 guideline is admissible only on the issue of whether the health
  9  1 care provider is entitled to establish an affirmative defense
  9  2 under the bill. There shall be no presumption of negligence
  9  3 if a health care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based
  9  4 medical practice guideline.

       jh/nh
  5 23 care provider's negligence or intentional misconduct.
  5 24    b.  The health care provider's failure to properly follow
  5 25 an evidence=based medical practice guideline where such
  5 26 failure was caused by the health care provider's negligence or
  5 27 intentional misconduct.
  5 28    5.  There shall be no presumption of negligence if a health
  5 29 care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based medical
  5 30 practice guideline.
  5 31                           EXPLANATION
  5 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 34    This bill relates to medical malpractice claims, including
  5 35 expert witnesses and defenses.
  6  1 ADVERSE HEALTH CARE INCIDENTS.  Under Code chapter 135P, if
  6  2 an adverse health care incident occurs, a health care provider

  6 31    EXPERT WITNESSES IN MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CASES.  The
  6 32 bill provides standards for an expert witness in a medical
  6 33 malpractice case. The bill provides that a person is

  8  1 merit affidavit does not preclude additional discovery and
  8  2 supplementation of the expert witness's opinions.

  8  8 plaintiff for failure to comply with the bill requirements
  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20

  8  8 plaintiff for failure to comply with the bill requirements
  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20

  8 35 guideline is admissible only on the issue of whether the health
  9  1 care provider is entitled to establish an affirmative defense
  9  2 under the bill. There shall be no presumption of negligence
  9  3 if a health care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based

  6  1 ADVERSE HEALTH CARE INCIDENTS.  Under Code chapter 135P, if
  6  2 an adverse health care incident occurs, a health care provider
  6  3 may offer to engage in an open discussion with the patient. If
  6  4 the patient agrees, the health care provider may investigate
  6  5 the incident, disclose the results to the patient, and discuss
  6  6 steps the health care provider will take to prevent similar
  6  7 incidents. The health care provider may also communicate to
  6  8 the patient whether the health care provider believes that
  6  9 an offer of compensation is warranted. All communications
  6 10 made related to the open discussion are privileged and
  6 11 confidential, are not subject to discovery or subpoena, and
  6 12 are not admissible in evidence in a judicial, administrative,
  6 13 or arbitration proceeding. Under current Code chapter 135P,
  6 14 "health care provider" is defined as a physician licensed under
  6 15 Code chapter 148, a physician assistant licensed under Code
  6 16 chapter 148C, a podiatrist licensed under Code chapter 149, or
  6 17 an advanced registered nurse practitioner licensed pursuant

  6 30 course of business or in the practice of a profession.
  6 31    EXPERT WITNESSES IN MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CASES.  The
  6 32 bill provides standards for an expert witness in a medical
  6 33 malpractice case. The bill provides that a person is
  6 34 only qualified to serve as an expert witness in a medical
  6 35 malpractice case if the person is a licensed health care
  7  1 provider, is in good standing in each state of licensure, and
  7  2 in the five years preceding the act or omission alleged to
  7  3 be negligent, has not had a license in any state revoked or
  7  4 suspended; in the five years preceding the act or omission
  7  5 alleged to be negligent, actively practiced in the same field
  7  6 as the defendant or was a qualified instructor at an accredited
  7  7 university in the same field as the defendant; practiced or
  7  8 provided instruction in the same or substantially similar
  7  9 specialty as the defendant; is trained and experienced in the
  7 10 same discipline or school of practice as the defendant or

  7 12 performed in the case; and, if the defendant is board=certified
  7 13 in a specialty, the person is certified in the same specialty.
  7 14    The bill establishes a requirement for a certificate of
  7 15 merit affidavit for expert witnesses in medical malpractice
  7 16 cases. In an action for personal injury or wrongful death
  7 17 against a health care provider based upon alleged negligence
  7 18 in the practice of that profession or in patient care, the
  7 19 bill requires the plaintiff, within 90 days of the defendant's
  7 20 answer, to serve upon the defendant a certificate of merit
  7 21 affidavit for each expert witness who will testify with respect
  7 22 to the issues of standard of care, breach of standard of care,
  7 23 or causation.  A certificate of merit affidavit must be signed
  7 24 by the expert witness and certify the purpose for calling
  7 25 the expert witness by providing under the oath of the expert
  7 26 witness the expert witness's statement of familiarity with the
  7 27 applicable standard of care; statement that the standard of
  7 28 care was breached by the health care provider; statement of the
  7 29 actions that the health care provider failed to take or should
  7 30 have taken; and statement of the manner by which the breach of
  7 31 the standard of care was the cause of the injury.
  7 32    The bill provides that answers to interrogatories may
  7 33 serve as an expert witness's certificate of merit affidavit
  7 34 if the interrogatories satisfy the requirements of the bill.
  7 35 The bill provides that the expert witness's certificate of
  8  1 merit affidavit does not preclude additional discovery and
  8  2 supplementation of the expert witness's opinions.
  8  3    The bill provides that failure to substantially comply with
  8  4 the new requirements shall result, upon motion, in dismissal
  8  5 with prejudice of each cause of action as to which expert
  8  6 witness testimony is necessary to establish a prima facie
  8  7 case. A written notice of deficiency may be served upon the
  8  8 plaintiff for failure to comply with the bill requirements
  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20
  8 11 days to cure the deficiency. Failure to comply within the 20
  8 12 days shall result, upon motion, in mandatory dismissal with
  8 13 prejudice of each action as to which expert witness testimony
  8 14 is necessary to establish a prima facie case.
  8 15    EVIDENCE=BASED MEDICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES.  The bill
  8 16 defines "evidence=based medical practice guidelines" as
  8 17 voluntary medical practice parameters or protocols established
  8 18 and released through a recognized physician consensus=building
  8 19 organization.
  8 20    The bill provides that in any action for personal injury
  8 21 or wrongful death against a health care provider based
  8 22 upon the alleged negligence of the health care provider in
  8 23 patient care, the health care provider may establish as an
  8 24 affirmative defense that the health care provider complied with
  8 25 evidence=based medical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and
  8 26 treatment of the patient.
  8 27    The bill provides that the court shall admit evidence=based
  8 28 medical practice guidelines into evidence if introduced by a
  8 29 health care provider or the health care provider's employer
  8 30 and if the health care provider or the health care provider's
  8 31 employer submits evidence that the evidence=based medical
  8 32 practice guideline was appropriate for the patient and that
  8 33 the health care provider complied with such evidence=based
  8 34 medical practice guidelines. Evidence of departure from a
  8 35 guideline is admissible only on the issue of whether the health
  9  1 care provider is entitled to establish an affirmative defense
  9  2 under the bill. There shall be no presumption of negligence
  9  3 if a health care provider did not adhere to an evidence=based
  9  4 medical practice guideline.

  8 31 employer submits evidence that the evidence=based medical
  8 32 practice guideline was appropriate for the patient and that
  8 33 the health care provider complied with such evidence=based

  8  9 because of deficiencies in the certificate of merit affidavit
  8 10 or answers to interrogatories, and the plaintiff shall have 20
