  3 14     This bill authorizes the adjutant general of Iowa to waive
  3 15 certain requirements and limitations of the national guard
  3 16 educational assistance program.
  3 17    Currently, to be determined eligible for the program,

  3 20 student in a community college, a regents university, or an
  3 21 accredited private institution.  An eligible member of the
  3 22 national guard shall not receive educational assistance for
  3 23 more than 120 semester, or the equivalent, credit hours of
  3 24 undergraduate study, and a national guard member who has met
  3 25 the educational requirements for a baccalaureate degree is
  3 26 ineligible for educational assistance.  The adjutant general's
  3 27 decision on eligibility is final.
  3 28    The bill authorizes the adjutant general, in determining the
  3 29 eligibility of a national guard member, to waive the provision

  4  4 States.

  4 13 at least six years in military service.
  4 14    The bill makes corresponding changes to direct the
  4 15 college student aid commission to pay the amounts due to a
  4 16 postsecondary institution other than a community college,
  4 17 accredited postsecondary institution in Iowa, or a regents
  4 18 university if the adjutant general issues a waiver authorizing

  3 14     This bill authorizes the adjutant general of Iowa to waive
  3 15 certain requirements and limitations of the national guard
  3 16 educational assistance program.
  3 17    Currently, to be determined eligible for the program,
  3 18 a national guard member must submit an application to the
  3 19 adjutant general of Iowa, and be enrolled as an undergraduate
  3 20 student in a community college, a regents university, or an
  3 21 accredited private institution.  An eligible member of the
  3 22 national guard shall not receive educational assistance for
  3 23 more than 120 semester, or the equivalent, credit hours of
  3 24 undergraduate study, and a national guard member who has met
  3 25 the educational requirements for a baccalaureate degree is
  3 26 ineligible for educational assistance.  The adjutant general's
  3 27 decision on eligibility is final.
  3 28    The bill authorizes the adjutant general, in determining the
  3 29 eligibility of a national guard member, to waive the provision
  3 30 requiring enrollment in an Iowa postsecondary institution and
  3 31 the limitations relating to semester hours or the equivalent
  3 32 and for national guard members who have met the educational
  3 33 requirements for a baccalaureate degree if the postsecondary
  3 34 institution in which the national guard member is enrolled is
  3 35 accredited by the higher learning commission and the degree
  4  1 program in which the national guard member is enrolled is
  4  2 included on the current critical manning list issued by the
  4  3 national guard or a branch of the armed forces of the United
  4  4 States.
  4  5    Educational assistance for graduate or postgraduate studies
  4  6 shall not exceed the resident tuition rate established for
  4  7 regents universities for the graduate or professional program
  4  8 of enrollment or the resident tuition rate for the graduate or
  4  9 professional program at the institution in which the national
  4 10 guard member is enrolled, whichever amount is lower.  Such
  4 11 educational assistance is subject to recoupment if, following
  4 12 the last payment, the national guard member fails to complete
  4 13 at least six years in military service.
  4 14    The bill makes corresponding changes to direct the
  4 15 college student aid commission to pay the amounts due to a
  4 16 postsecondary institution other than a community college,
  4 17 accredited postsecondary institution in Iowa, or a regents
  4 18 university if the adjutant general issues a waiver authorizing
  4 19 a national guard member to enroll in such a postsecondary
  4 20 institution. The bill reorders but retains language relating
