  6 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 32    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 33 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 34 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 35 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  7  1 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  7  2 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  7  3 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  7  4 basis to at least one employee per district.
  7  5    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  7  6 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  7  7 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  8 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  9 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7 10 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7 11 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7 12 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7 13 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7 14 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7 15 program.
  7 16    The bill establishes a school climate improvement grant
  7 17 program in the department of education to build upon previous
  7 18 state efforts to promote school safety, including the Iowa safe
  7 19 and supportive schools grant and program, by providing funds to
  7 20 school districts and accredited nonpublic schools to maintain,
  7 21 improve, and promote safe and supportive learning environments
  7 22 in this state.
  7 23    The department shall award funds from the program to schools
  7 24 on a competitive grant basis. Awards shall be consistent with
  7 25 the goals of the program as specified in the bill.
  7 26    Grants from the program may be used to fund school programs
  7 27 or activities including but not limited to qualified staff
  7 28 training to implement Code section 280.28, technical assistance
  7 29 for improved classroom management, and certain other programs
  7 30 and activities specified in the bill.
  7 31    The department shall give priority in grant awards to
  7 32 certain applicants specified in the bill.
  7 33    The bill appropriates to the department for fiscal year
  7 34 2017=2018, for carryforward into fiscal year 2018=2019, $1
  7 35 million to be used for grants from the program.
  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  8  7 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  8 16 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 22 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 29 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 30 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 31 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 32 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 33 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 34 work group by October 1, 2017. The work group must submit
  9 35 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the

  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other

  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away

  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.

  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably

  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to

  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations

  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for

  6 32    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 33 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 34 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 35 training on conducting investigations of complaints of

  7  3 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  7  4 basis to at least one employee per district.
  7  5    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  7  6 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  7  7 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  8 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  9 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7 10 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7 11 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7 12 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7 13 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7 14 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7 15 program.
  7 16    The bill establishes a school climate improvement grant
  7 17 program in the department of education to build upon previous
  7 18 state efforts to promote school safety, including the Iowa safe
  7 19 and supportive schools grant and program, by providing funds to
  7 20 school districts and accredited nonpublic schools to maintain,
  7 21 improve, and promote safe and supportive learning environments
  7 22 in this state.
  7 23    The department shall award funds from the program to schools

  7 27 or activities including but not limited to qualified staff
  7 28 training to implement Code section 280.28, technical assistance
  7 29 for improved classroom management, and certain other programs
  7 30 and activities specified in the bill.
  7 31    The department shall give priority in grant awards to
  7 32 certain applicants specified in the bill.
  7 33    The bill appropriates to the department for fiscal year
  7 34 2017=2018, for carryforward into fiscal year 2018=2019, $1
  7 35 million to be used for grants from the program.
  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  8  7 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  8 16 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 22 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 29 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 30 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and

  9 34 work group by October 1, 2017. The work group must submit
  9 35 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the

  6 29                           EXPLANATION
  6 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 32    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 33 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 34 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 35 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  7  1 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  7  2 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  7  3 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  7  4 basis to at least one employee per district.
  7  5    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  7  6 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  7  7 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  8 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  9 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7 10 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7 11 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7 12 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7 13 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7 14 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7 15 program.
  7 16    The bill establishes a school climate improvement grant
  7 17 program in the department of education to build upon previous
  7 18 state efforts to promote school safety, including the Iowa safe
  7 19 and supportive schools grant and program, by providing funds to
  7 20 school districts and accredited nonpublic schools to maintain,
  7 21 improve, and promote safe and supportive learning environments
  7 22 in this state.
  7 23    The department shall award funds from the program to schools
  7 24 on a competitive grant basis. Awards shall be consistent with
  7 25 the goals of the program as specified in the bill.
  7 26    Grants from the program may be used to fund school programs
  7 27 or activities including but not limited to qualified staff
  7 28 training to implement Code section 280.28, technical assistance
  7 29 for improved classroom management, and certain other programs
  7 30 and activities specified in the bill.
  7 31    The department shall give priority in grant awards to
  7 32 certain applicants specified in the bill.
  7 33    The bill appropriates to the department for fiscal year
  7 34 2017=2018, for carryforward into fiscal year 2018=2019, $1
  7 35 million to be used for grants from the program.
  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  8  7 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  8 16 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 22 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 29 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 30 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 31 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 32 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 33 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 34 work group by October 1, 2017. The work group must submit
  9 35 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the

  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  8  7 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  8 16 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations

  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for

  6 34 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 35 training on conducting investigations of complaints of

  7  5    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  7  6 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  7  7 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  8 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  9 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7 10 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7 11 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7 12 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7 13 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7 14 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7 15 program.
  7 16    The bill establishes a school climate improvement grant
  7 17 program in the department of education to build upon previous
  7 18 state efforts to promote school safety, including the Iowa safe
  7 19 and supportive schools grant and program, by providing funds to
  7 20 school districts and accredited nonpublic schools to maintain,
  7 21 improve, and promote safe and supportive learning environments
  7 22 in this state.
  7 23    The department shall award funds from the program to schools

  7 29 for improved classroom management, and certain other programs
  7 30 and activities specified in the bill.
  7 31    The department shall give priority in grant awards to
  7 32 certain applicants specified in the bill.

  7 35 million to be used for grants from the program.
  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and

  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill

  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations

  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for

  6 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 32    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 33 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 34 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 35 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  7  1 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  7  2 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  7  3 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  7  4 basis to at least one employee per district.
  7  5    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  7  6 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  7  7 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  8 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  9 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7 10 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7 11 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7 12 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7 13 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7 14 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7 15 program.
  7 16    The bill establishes a school climate improvement grant
  7 17 program in the department of education to build upon previous
  7 18 state efforts to promote school safety, including the Iowa safe
  7 19 and supportive schools grant and program, by providing funds to
  7 20 school districts and accredited nonpublic schools to maintain,
  7 21 improve, and promote safe and supportive learning environments
  7 22 in this state.
  7 23    The department shall award funds from the program to schools
  7 24 on a competitive grant basis. Awards shall be consistent with
  7 25 the goals of the program as specified in the bill.
  7 26    Grants from the program may be used to fund school programs
  7 27 or activities including but not limited to qualified staff
  7 28 training to implement Code section 280.28, technical assistance
  7 29 for improved classroom management, and certain other programs
  7 30 and activities specified in the bill.
  7 31    The department shall give priority in grant awards to
  7 32 certain applicants specified in the bill.

  7 34 2017=2018, for carryforward into fiscal year 2018=2019, $1
  7 35 million to be used for grants from the program.
  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  8  7 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  8 16 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 22 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 29 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 30 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 31 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership

  9 34 work group by October 1, 2017. The work group must submit
  9 35 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the

  7 34 2017=2018, for carryforward into fiscal year 2018=2019, $1
  7 35 million to be used for grants from the program.
  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  8  7 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  8 16 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 22 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of

  6 29                           EXPLANATION
  6 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 32    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 33 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 34 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 35 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  7  1 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  7  2 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  7  3 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  7  4 basis to at least one employee per district.
  7  5    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  7  6 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  7  7 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  8 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  9 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7 10 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7 11 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7 12 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7 13 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7 14 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7 15 program.
  7 16    The bill establishes a school climate improvement grant
  7 17 program in the department of education to build upon previous
  7 18 state efforts to promote school safety, including the Iowa safe
  7 19 and supportive schools grant and program, by providing funds to
  7 20 school districts and accredited nonpublic schools to maintain,
  7 21 improve, and promote safe and supportive learning environments
  7 22 in this state.
  7 23    The department shall award funds from the program to schools
  7 24 on a competitive grant basis. Awards shall be consistent with
  7 25 the goals of the program as specified in the bill.
  7 26    Grants from the program may be used to fund school programs
  7 27 or activities including but not limited to qualified staff
  7 28 training to implement Code section 280.28, technical assistance
  7 29 for improved classroom management, and certain other programs
  7 30 and activities specified in the bill.
  7 31    The department shall give priority in grant awards to
  7 32 certain applicants specified in the bill.
  7 33    The bill appropriates to the department for fiscal year
  7 34 2017=2018, for carryforward into fiscal year 2018=2019, $1
  7 35 million to be used for grants from the program.
  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  8  7 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  8 16 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 22 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 29 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 30 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 31 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 32 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 33 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 34 work group by October 1, 2017. The work group must submit
  9 35 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
 10  1 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
 10  2 senate and house education committees by December 22, 2017.

  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other

  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.

  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for

  6 29                           EXPLANATION
  6 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 32    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 33 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 34 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 35 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  7  1 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  7  2 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  7  3 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  7  4 basis to at least one employee per district.
  7  5    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  7  6 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  7  7 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  8 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  9 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7 10 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7 11 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7 12 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7 13 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7 14 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7 15 program.
  7 16    The bill establishes a school climate improvement grant
  7 17 program in the department of education to build upon previous
  7 18 state efforts to promote school safety, including the Iowa safe
  7 19 and supportive schools grant and program, by providing funds to
  7 20 school districts and accredited nonpublic schools to maintain,
  7 21 improve, and promote safe and supportive learning environments
  7 22 in this state.
  7 23    The department shall award funds from the program to schools
  7 24 on a competitive grant basis. Awards shall be consistent with
  7 25 the goals of the program as specified in the bill.
  7 26    Grants from the program may be used to fund school programs
  7 27 or activities including but not limited to qualified staff
  7 28 training to implement Code section 280.28, technical assistance
  7 29 for improved classroom management, and certain other programs
  7 30 and activities specified in the bill.
  7 31    The department shall give priority in grant awards to
  7 32 certain applicants specified in the bill.
  7 33    The bill appropriates to the department for fiscal year
  7 34 2017=2018, for carryforward into fiscal year 2018=2019, $1
  7 35 million to be used for grants from the program.
  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  8  7 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  8 16 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 22 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 29 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 30 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 31 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 32 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 33 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 34 work group by October 1, 2017. The work group must submit
  9 35 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
 10  1 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
 10  2 senate and house education committees by December 22, 2017.

  6 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 32    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 33 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 34 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 35 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  7  1 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  7  2 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  7  3 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  7  4 basis to at least one employee per district.
  7  5    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  7  6 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  7  7 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  8 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  9 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7 10 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7 11 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7 12 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7 13 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7 14 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7 15 program.
  7 16    The bill establishes a school climate improvement grant
  7 17 program in the department of education to build upon previous
  7 18 state efforts to promote school safety, including the Iowa safe
  7 19 and supportive schools grant and program, by providing funds to
  7 20 school districts and accredited nonpublic schools to maintain,
  7 21 improve, and promote safe and supportive learning environments
  7 22 in this state.
  7 23    The department shall award funds from the program to schools
  7 24 on a competitive grant basis. Awards shall be consistent with
  7 25 the goals of the program as specified in the bill.
  7 26    Grants from the program may be used to fund school programs
  7 27 or activities including but not limited to qualified staff
  7 28 training to implement Code section 280.28, technical assistance
  7 29 for improved classroom management, and certain other programs
  7 30 and activities specified in the bill.
  7 31    The department shall give priority in grant awards to
  7 32 certain applicants specified in the bill.
  7 33    The bill appropriates to the department for fiscal year
  7 34 2017=2018, for carryforward into fiscal year 2018=2019, $1
  7 35 million to be used for grants from the program.
  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  8  7 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  8 16 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 22 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 29 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 30 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 31 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 32 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 33 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 34 work group by October 1, 2017. The work group must submit
  9 35 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
 10  1 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
 10  2 senate and house education committees by December 22, 2017.

  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based

  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other

  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the

  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away

  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.

  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for

  7  8 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  9 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7 10 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7 11 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7 12 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7 13 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7 14 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7 15 program.
  7 16    The bill establishes a school climate improvement grant
  7 17 program in the department of education to build upon previous
  7 18 state efforts to promote school safety, including the Iowa safe
  7 19 and supportive schools grant and program, by providing funds to
  7 20 school districts and accredited nonpublic schools to maintain,
  7 21 improve, and promote safe and supportive learning environments
  7 22 in this state.
  7 23    The department shall award funds from the program to schools

  7 30 and activities specified in the bill.
  7 31    The department shall give priority in grant awards to

  7 35 million to be used for grants from the program.
  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  8  7 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  8 16 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations

  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 29 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 30 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and

  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic

  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away

  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.

  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for

  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The

  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic

  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment

  6 34 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 35 training on conducting investigations of complaints of

  7  5    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  7  6 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  7  7 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  8 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  9 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7 10 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7 11 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7 12 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7 13 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7 14 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the

  7 16    The bill establishes a school climate improvement grant
  7 17 program in the department of education to build upon previous
  7 18 state efforts to promote school safety, including the Iowa safe
  7 19 and supportive schools grant and program, by providing funds to
  7 20 school districts and accredited nonpublic schools to maintain,
  7 21 improve, and promote safe and supportive learning environments
  7 22 in this state.
  7 23    The department shall award funds from the program to schools

  7 29 for improved classroom management, and certain other programs
  7 30 and activities specified in the bill.
  7 31    The department shall give priority in grant awards to

  7 35 million to be used for grants from the program.
  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  8  7 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  8 16 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 22 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 29 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 30 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 31 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 32 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 33 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 34 work group by October 1, 2017. The work group must submit
  9 35 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
 10  1 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
 10  2 senate and house education committees by December 22, 2017.

  7  8 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  9 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7 10 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7 11 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7 12 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban

  7 16    The bill establishes a school climate improvement grant
  7 17 program in the department of education to build upon previous
  7 18 state efforts to promote school safety, including the Iowa safe
  7 19 and supportive schools grant and program, by providing funds to
  7 20 school districts and accredited nonpublic schools to maintain,
  7 21 improve, and promote safe and supportive learning environments
  7 22 in this state.
  7 23    The department shall award funds from the program to schools

  7 29 for improved classroom management, and certain other programs
  7 30 and activities specified in the bill.
  7 31    The department shall give priority in grant awards to

  7 35 million to be used for grants from the program.
  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  8  7 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  8 16 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 22 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 29 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 30 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 31 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 32 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 33 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 34 work group by October 1, 2017. The work group must submit
  9 35 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
 10  1 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the

  7 16    The bill establishes a school climate improvement grant
  7 17 program in the department of education to build upon previous
  7 18 state efforts to promote school safety, including the Iowa safe
  7 19 and supportive schools grant and program, by providing funds to
  7 20 school districts and accredited nonpublic schools to maintain,
  7 21 improve, and promote safe and supportive learning environments
  7 22 in this state.

  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  8  7 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  8 16 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations

  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 29 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 30 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 31 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 32 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 33 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 34 work group by October 1, 2017. The work group must submit
  9 35 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the

  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based

  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill

  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted

  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away

  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations

  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 29 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 30 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and

  7  5    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  7  6 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  7  7 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  8 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  9 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7 10 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7 11 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7 12 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7 13 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7 14 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7 15 program.
  7 16    The bill establishes a school climate improvement grant
  7 17 program in the department of education to build upon previous
  7 18 state efforts to promote school safety, including the Iowa safe
  7 19 and supportive schools grant and program, by providing funds to
  7 20 school districts and accredited nonpublic schools to maintain,
  7 21 improve, and promote safe and supportive learning environments
  7 22 in this state.
  7 23    The department shall award funds from the program to schools

  7 29 for improved classroom management, and certain other programs
  7 30 and activities specified in the bill.
  7 31    The department shall give priority in grant awards to
  7 32 certain applicants specified in the bill.

  7 35 million to be used for grants from the program.
  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  8  7 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  8 16 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 22 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 29 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 30 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 31 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 32 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 33 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 34 work group by October 1, 2017. The work group must submit
  9 35 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
 10  1 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
 10  2 senate and house education committees by December 22, 2017.

  7 16    The bill establishes a school climate improvement grant
  7 17 program in the department of education to build upon previous

  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and

  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is

  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment

  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations

  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 29 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 30 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and

  9 34 work group by October 1, 2017. The work group must submit
  9 35 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the

  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted

  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away

  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and

  6 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 32    This bill requires the director of the department of
  6 33 education, subject to an appropriation of funds by the general
  6 34 assembly, to ensure each school district has access to adequate
  6 35 training on conducting investigations of complaints of
  7  1 incidents of harassment or bullying pursuant to Code section
  7  2 280.28, the state law relating to school antiharassment and
  7  3 antibullying policies, by offering such training on an annual
  7  4 basis to at least one employee per district.
  7  5    The bill requires the department of education, subject to an
  7  6 appropriation of funds by the general assembly, to establish
  7  7 a student mentoring pilot program to explore how student
  7  8 leadership can help prevent bullying and violence in schools.
  7  9 The program shall promote best practices for bullying and
  7 10 violence prevention for middle and high school students. The
  7 11 department must establish the program in at least two middle
  7 12 schools and two high schools, which shall include both urban
  7 13 and rural schools. The department must establish criteria
  7 14 for selection of participating schools and evaluation of the
  7 15 program.
  7 16    The bill establishes a school climate improvement grant
  7 17 program in the department of education to build upon previous
  7 18 state efforts to promote school safety, including the Iowa safe
  7 19 and supportive schools grant and program, by providing funds to
  7 20 school districts and accredited nonpublic schools to maintain,
  7 21 improve, and promote safe and supportive learning environments
  7 22 in this state.
  7 23    The department shall award funds from the program to schools
  7 24 on a competitive grant basis. Awards shall be consistent with
  7 25 the goals of the program as specified in the bill.
  7 26    Grants from the program may be used to fund school programs
  7 27 or activities including but not limited to qualified staff
  7 28 training to implement Code section 280.28, technical assistance
  7 29 for improved classroom management, and certain other programs
  7 30 and activities specified in the bill.
  7 31    The department shall give priority in grant awards to
  7 32 certain applicants specified in the bill.
  7 33    The bill appropriates to the department for fiscal year
  7 34 2017=2018, for carryforward into fiscal year 2018=2019, $1
  7 35 million to be used for grants from the program.
  8  1 The bill modifies the definition of "electronic" under Code
  8  2 section 280.28 by adding any other electronic communication
  8  3 site, device, or means to the definition and by including
  8  4 social networking sites as part of the term "internet=based
  8  5 communications".
  8  6    Under Code section 280.28, subsection 2, "harassment" and
  8  7 "bullying" shall be construed to mean any electronic, written,
  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill
  8 15 provides that the definition of "harassment" and "bullying" is
  8 16 to be construed broadly to achieve the purposes of the law.
  8 17    The bill requires school antiharassment and antibullying
  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to
  8 27 investigate and impose school discipline or take other action
  8 28 in cases of alleged incidents of harassment or bullying that
  8 29 occur outside of school, off of school property, or away from
  8 30 school functions or school=sponsored activities if certain
  8 31 conditions are met. Those conditions are that an incident of
  8 32 harassment or bullying is reported pursuant to the school's
  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away
  9 11 from a school function or school=sponsored activity may include
  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations
  9 22 who have experience and expertise in the areas of antibullying
  9 23 education, research, and training. The work group, after
  9 24 reviewing existing research, data, and strategies, shall
  9 25 provide recommendations to the department regarding matters
  9 26 to enhance statewide school climate improvement and bullying
  9 27 prevention, awareness, and intervention. The bill provides for
  9 28 membership of the work group to be appointed by the director of
  9 29 the department. When making appointments to the work group,
  9 30 the director must ensure that public, nonpublic, urban, and
  9 31 rural schools are adequately represented by the membership
  9 32 of the work group. The work group shall also include ex
  9 33 officio legislative members. The department must convene the
  9 34 work group by October 1, 2017. The work group must submit
  9 35 its findings and recommendations in a final report to the
 10  1 department and the chairpersons and ranking members of the
 10  2 senate and house education committees by December 22, 2017.

  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering

  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment

  8  8 verbal, or physical act or conduct toward a student which is
  8  9 based on any actual or perceived trait or characteristic of
  8 10 the student and which creates an objectively hostile school
  8 11 environment that meets one or more of certain conditions. The
  8 12 bill modifies the definition of "harassment" and "bullying"
  8 13 under Code section 280.28 by adding behavior or any other
  8 14 distinguishing characteristic to the definition. The bill

  8 18 policies to include a procedure for the notification as soon as
  8 19 practicable of the parents or guardians of the alleged targeted
  8 20 students and perpetrators in a reported incident of harassment
  8 21 or bullying.  The procedure must include an exception to the
  8 22 notification requirement if a school official or a student
  8 23 whose parent or guardian would otherwise be notified reasonably
  8 24 believes notification would subject the targeted student to
  8 25 rejection, abuse, or neglect.
  8 26    The bill grants school officials the authority to

  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away

  9 12 referring the matter to appropriate community=based agencies.
  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an
  9 16 unfounded incident of harassment or bullying if a student's
  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
  9 19    The bill requires the department of education to convene
  9 20 a public=private work group of representatives of state and
  9 21 local agencies, citizens, community groups, and organizations

  8 33 antiharassment and antibullying policy; and that the alleged
  8 34 incident of harassment or bullying has an effect on school
  8 35 grounds that creates an objectively hostile school environment
  9  1 that places the student in reasonable fear of harm to the
  9  2 student's person or property; has a substantially detrimental
  9  3 effect on the student's physical or mental health; has the
  9  4 effect of substantially interfering with a student's academic
  9  5 performance; or has the effect of substantially interfering
  9  6 with the student's ability to participate in or benefit from
  9  7 the services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.
  9  8    The bill provides that a school official's investigation
  9  9 and response to an alleged incident of bullying or harassment
  9 10 that occurs outside of school, off of school property, or away

  9 13    The bill provides that Code section 280.28 shall not be
  9 14 construed to diminish a school administrator's discretion
  9 15 to impose discipline or take other action in the case of an

  9 17 behavior otherwise constitutes student misconduct based on
  9 18 other grounds.
