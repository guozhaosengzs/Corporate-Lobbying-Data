  2 24 interim study committee to determine whether opportunities
  2 25 exist for the use of pay for success bonds in Iowa.  The bill

  2 30 evaluator determines that the predefined outcomes have been
  2 31 achieved, the government repays the investors their principal
  2 32 and a rate of return; otherwise, the investors lose their
  2 33 capital.

  2 35 of legislative members who shall be voting members of the
  3  1 committee, and representatives from the department of human
