  1 10 or a city council has procured accident or health care coverage
  1 11 for its employees under this chapter, such coverage shall
  1 12 permit continuation of existing coverage or reenrollment in

  1 16    b.  A governing body, a county board of supervisors, or

  1 25    3.  A surviving child of an eligible peace officer shall be
  1 26 provided coverage as required by this section, with the full
