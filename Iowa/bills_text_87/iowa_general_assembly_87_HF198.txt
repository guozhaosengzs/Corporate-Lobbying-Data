 12  1                           EXPLANATION
 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,
 15 32 2017.

 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a

 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,

 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.

 12  1                           EXPLANATION
 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 12  1                           EXPLANATION
 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,
 15 32 2017.

 12  1                           EXPLANATION
 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,
 15 32 2017.

 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,
 15 32 2017.

 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,

 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners

 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical

 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general

 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain

 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following

 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides

 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a

 12  1                           EXPLANATION
 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,
 15 32 2017.

 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,
 15 32 2017.

 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,
 15 32 2017.

 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,

 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the

 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution

 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as

 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of

 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The

 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general

 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and

 12  1                           EXPLANATION
 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,
 15 32 2017.

 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,

 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the

 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to

 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain

 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a

 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,

 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,
 15 32 2017.

 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified

 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical

 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).

 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior

 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 12  1                           EXPLANATION
 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 12  1                           EXPLANATION
 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).

 12  1                           EXPLANATION
 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,
 15 32 2017.

 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.

 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The

 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior

 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public

 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical

 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of

 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to

 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain

 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following

 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,

 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined

 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in

 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties

 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public

 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,

 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior

 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and

 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of

 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.

 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to

 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,

 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 12  1                           EXPLANATION
 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a

 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain

 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and

 12  1                           EXPLANATION
 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no

 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and

 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 12  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is
 12  8 lawful for a person to knowingly or intentionally recommend,
 12  9 process, produce, possess, use, dispense, deliver, transport,
 12 10 or administer medical cannabis if the recommendation,
 12 11 processing, production, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
 12 12 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
 12 13 provisions of the bill.
 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this

 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution

 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 12  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12  4    This bill creates the medical cannabis Act and provides for
 12  5 criminal penalties.
 12  6    The bill amends Code section 124.401, relating to prohibited
 12  7 acts involving controlled substances, to provide that it is

 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a

 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil

 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been

 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,

 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,
 13 23 manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, and transport
 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain

 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The

 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general

 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).

 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,

 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the

 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.

 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant

 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a

 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and

 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial

 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain

 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.

 12 14    The bill establishes new Code chapter 124E, the medical
 12 15 cannabis Act, to allow for the medical use of cannabis for
 12 16 alleviating symptoms caused by debilitating medical conditions
 12 17 and their medical treatments.  The bill defines "medical use
 12 18 of cannabis" to mean the acquisition, possession, cultivation,
 12 19 manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of
 12 20 cannabis or related paraphernalia to treat or alleviate a
 12 21 registered qualified patient's debilitating medical condition
 12 22 as defined in the bill. The bill defines "cannabis" to mean
 12 23 all parts of the plants of the genus cannabis, whether growing
 12 24 or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of
 12 25 the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative,
 12 26 mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds, or resin,
 12 27 including tetrahydrocannabinols.  It does not include the
 12 28 mature stalks of the plant; fiber produced from the stalks; oil
 12 29 or cake made from the seeds of the plant; any other compound,
 12 30 manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the
 12 31 mature stalks, except the resin extracted therefrom; fiber;
 12 32 or oil or cake or the sterilized seed of the plant which is
 12 33 incapable of germination (see also Code section 124.101(19)).
 12 34    The bill provides that a qualified patient who has been
 12 35 issued and who possesses a registry identification card issued
 13  1 by the department of public health shall not be subject to
 13  2 arrest or prosecution, civil or criminal penalty, or the denial
 13  3 of any right or privilege regarding the medical use of cannabis
 13  4 if the quantity of cannabis does not exceed an adequate supply.
 13  5 The bill also provides the same immunity for a qualified
 13  6 patient's primary caregiver and for a licensed producer.
 13  7    The bill defines a qualified patient as a resident of this
 13  8 state who has been diagnosed by a practitioner as having a
 13  9 debilitating medical condition as specified in the bill and
 13 10 who has received written certification by a practitioner and
 13 11 has been issued a registry identification card pursuant to the
 13 12 new Code chapter. A qualified patient may designate one or
 13 13 more primary caregivers. A primary caregiver is defined as a
 13 14 resident of this state, at least 18 years old, who has been
 13 15 designated by the patient's practitioner or a person having
 13 16 legal custody of the qualified patient as being necessary to
 13 17 take responsibility for managing the well=being of a qualified
 13 18 patient with respect to the medical use of cannabis pursuant
 13 19 to the provisions of the bill.  "Licensed producer" is defined
 13 20 as any qualified patient, primary caregiver, or nonprofit
 13 21 private entity within this state that the department of public
 13 22 health determines to be qualified to process, produce, possess,

 13 24 cannabis in this state under the bill.  A qualified patient or
 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in
 13 28 this state to prescribe and administer a controlled substance
 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of
 13 31 cannabis program by a qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 32 does not relieve the qualified patient or primary caregiver
 13 33 from prosecution or civil penalties for activities not
 13 34 authorized under the bill, liability for damages or criminal
 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).

 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a

 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later

 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information

 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general

 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).

 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).

 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a

 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.

 13 25 primary caregiver licensed as a producer shall produce no more
 13 26 than an adequate supply of cannabis for the patient's personal
 13 27 use only. "Practitioner" is defined as a person licensed in

 13 29 regulated under Code chapter 124.
 13 30    The bill provides that participation in the medical use of

 13 35 prosecution arising out of the operation of a vehicle while
 14  1 under the influence of cannabis, or other criminal prosecution
 14  2 or civil penalties for possession or use of cannabis in certain
 14  3 situations.  A qualified patient or primary caregiver who
 14  4 makes a fraudulent representation to a law enforcement officer
 14  5 about the person's medical use of cannabis to avoid arrest
 14  6 or prosecution for a cannabis=related offense is guilty of a
 14  7 simple misdemeanor.
 14  8    The bill directs the department of public health to
 14  9 establish a medical cannabis advisory council no later
 14 10 than August 15, 2017, consisting of eight practitioners
 14 11 representing the fields of neurology, pain management, medical
 14 12 oncology, psychiatry, infectious disease, family medicine,
 14 13 and gynecology.  The practitioners shall be nationally
 14 14 board=certified in their area of specialty and knowledgeable
 14 15 about the medical use of cannabis and appointed by the
 14 16 director of public health from a list proposed by the Iowa
 14 17 medical society.  The advisory council, among other duties as
 14 18 specified in the bill, is required to review and recommend to
 14 19 the department for approval additional debilitating medical
 14 20 conditions and accept and review petitions to add medical
 14 21 conditions, medical treatments, or diseases to the list of
 14 22 debilitating medical conditions that qualify for the medical
 14 23 use of cannabis.
 14 24    The department is required to adopt rules pursuant to
 14 25 Code chapter 17A to establish and implement a medical use of
 14 26 cannabis program consistent with the purpose of the bill no
 14 27 later than October 1, 2017, and may adopt emergency rules. The
 14 28 department is required to maintain confidential information
 14 29 collected pursuant to the bill and provide for the release of
 14 30 certain information to certain persons under confidentiality
 14 31 guidelines and to submit an annual report to the general
 14 32 assembly by January 15 of each year.
 14 33    The department is also required to issue a registry
 14 34 identification card to a qualified patient and any primary
 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain
 15  2 information in an application to the department.  The bill
 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or
 15  5 give rise to reasonable suspicion for a governmental agency
 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior
 15 10 to the effective date of the bill shall remain effective and
 15 11 continues in effect as issued for the 12=month period following
 15 12 its issuance.
 15 13    Code chapter 124D, the medical cannabidiol Act, currently
 15 14 allows an Iowa licensed neurologist who has examined and
 15 15 treated a patient suffering from intractable epilepsy to
 15 16 provide a written recommendation for the patient's medical use
 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives
 15 20 a written recommendation from the patient's neurologist or
 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
 15 28 of the medical cannabidiol Act is subject to the penalties
 15 29 provided under Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 15 30 453B (excise taxes on unlawful dealing in certain substances).
 15 31    Code chapter 124D is repealed by its own terms on July 1,

 14 35 caregiver named in the qualified patient's application, if the
 15  1 qualified patient and each primary caregiver submit certain

 15  3 provides that possession of or application for a registry
 15  4 identification card shall not constitute probable cause or

 15  6 to search the person or property of the person possessing or
 15  7 applying for the card.
 15  8    The bill provides that a cannabidiol registration card
 15  9 issued under Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act) prior

 15 17 of cannabidiol to treat or alleviate symptoms of intractable
 15 18 epilepsy if no other satisfactory alternative treatment options
 15 19 exist and if certain conditions apply.  A patient who receives

 15 21 the patient's primary caregiver is required to have a valid
 15 22 cannabidiol registration card to use or possess cannabidiol
 15 23 for medical purposes.  The cannabidiol must be obtained from
 15 24 an out=of=state source.  The medical cannabidiol Act provides
 15 25 affirmative defenses to a neurologist, a patient, and a
 15 26 primary caregiver from prosecution.  A person who knowingly
 15 27 or intentionally possesses or uses cannabidiol in violation
