_____


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
1


This
bill
relates
to
adoption
and
termination
of
parental
2


rights.
The
bill
defines
“adoption
service
provider”
to
3


include
a
licensed
child-placing
agency
or
a
licensed
attorney.
4


The
bill
eliminates
the
definition
of
and
the
use
of
the
term
5


“independent
placement”
relative
to
termination
of
parental
6


rights
and
adoption
proceedings,
thereby
only
allowing
adoption
7


service
providers
and
the
department
of
human
services
(DHS)
to
8


make
placements
of
minor
children
for
the
purposes
of
adoption.
9


The
bill
also
defines
“certified
adoption
investigator”,
for
10


the
purposes
of
termination
of
parental
rights
and
adoption
11


proceedings,
replacing
the
term
“investigator”
which
did
not
12


require
certification
or
approval
of
such
investigators
by
13


the
department
of
human
services.
The
bill
makes
conforming
14


changes
throughout
the
Code
to
reflect
the
new
definitions,
15


including
relative
to
allowable
tax
deductions
from
net
income.
16


The
bill
clarifies
that
the
one
certified
copy
of
the
17


adoption
decree
to
the
petitioner,
and
the
one
copy
of
any
18


adoption
decree
to
DHS,
an
adoption
service
provider,
and
the
19


state
registrar
of
vital
statistics,
currently
required
to
be
20


provided
by
the
clerk
of
the
court,
are
to
be
provided
at
no
21


charge.
22


The
bill
requires
reporting
of
expenditures
and
limitations
23


on
payment
of
only
allowable
expenditures
relating
to
24


termination
of
parental
rights
similar
to
those
requirements
25


currently
in
place
for
adoption.
As
with
adoptions,
the
bill
26


prohibits
a
biological
parent
from
receiving
any
thing
of
value
27


as
a
result
of
the
biological
parent
terminating
the
parent’s
28


parental
rights,
unless
that
thing
of
value
is
an
allowable
29


expense
as
provided
in
the
bill.
Any
person
assisting
in
any
30


way
with
the
termination
of
parental
rights
is
prohibited
31


from
charging
a
fee
which
is
more
than
usual,
necessary,
and
32


commensurate
with
the
services
rendered.
If
the
biological
33


parent
receives
any
prohibited
thing
of
value,
if
a
person
34


gives
a
prohibited
thing
of
value,
or
if
a
person
charges
a

As
with
an
adoption
petitioner,
the
bill
also
requires
a
2


termination
of
parental
rights
petitioner
to
file
with
the
3


juvenile
court
or
court,
prior
to
the
termination
hearing,
a
4


full
accounting
of
all
disbursements
of
any
thing
of
value
5


paid
or
agreed
to
be
paid
by
or
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
6


or
intended
adoptive
parent
in
connection
with
the
petitioned
7


termination.
The
accounting
is
to
be
made
by
a
report
8


prescribed
by
the
juvenile
court
or
court
and
signed
and
9


verified
by
the
petitioner.
The
report
is
required
to
be
10


accompanied
by
documentation
of
all
disbursements
made
prior
to
11


the
date
of
filing
of
the

The
bill
specifies
allowable
12


expenses
similar
to
those
allowed
relative
to
an
adoption
13


proceeding.
14


Additionally,
the
bill
provides
that
all
payments
for
15


allowable
expenses
shall
be
made
through
the
adoption
16


service
provider
and
that
the
adoption
service
provider
shall
17


deposit
all
funds
received
into
an
escrow
account.
The
bill
18


specifies
that
such
escrow
funds
shall
not
be
commingled
with
19


other
revenues
or
expense
accounts
of
the
adoption
service
20


provider
and
separate
accounting
shall
be
maintained
for
each
21


prospective
adoptive
parent
whose
funds
are
deposited
in
the
22


escrow
account.
Any
escrow
funds
not
disbursed
by
the
adoption
23


service
provider
for
the
benefit
of
the
designated
biological
24


parent
shall
be
returned
to
the
prospective
adoptive
parents
25


with
a
full
accounting
of
all
deposits
and
disbursements.
26


The
bill
provides
that
if
the
adoption
service
provider
is
a
27


licensed
attorney,
use
of
the
attorney’s
state-sanctioned
trust
28


account
shall
satisfy
the
requirement
relative
to
the
escrow
29


account.


30


As
with
similar
provisions
relating
to
payment
of
allowable
31


expenses
under
an
adoption
proceeding,
any
payments
for
32


allowable
expenses
relative
to
a
termination
of
parental
rights
33


proceeding
shall
not
be
made
to
a
biological
parent,
but
34


instead
shall
be
made
directly
to
the
provider
of
the
service,
