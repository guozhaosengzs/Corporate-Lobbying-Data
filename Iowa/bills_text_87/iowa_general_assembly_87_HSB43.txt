voted
at
the
last
preceding
general
election.
The
bill
defines
1


“qualified
county”
to
mean
a
county
with
a
population
in
excess
2


of
400,000,
a
county
with
a
population
of
at
least
130,000
but
3


not
more
than
131,000,
or
a
county
with
a
population
of
at
4


least
60,000
but
not
more
than
70,000,
according
to
the
2010
5


federal
decennial
census.
For
those
qualified
counties,
the
6


bill
also
removes
the
requirement
that
in
order
to
have
the
7


local
sales
and
services
tax
presented
to
the
voters,
motions
8


must
be
approved

cities
or
the
county
for
the
unincorporated
9


area,
representing
at
least
one-half
of
the
county’s
10


population.
Instead,
the
bill
allows
individual
cities
or
the
11


county
for
the
unincorporated
area
within
a
qualified
county
12


to
approve
a
motion
for
an
election
on
the
local
sales
and
13


services
tax
to
be
held
in
only
that
jurisdiction.

except
for
purposes
of
allocating
15


local
sales
and
services
tax
receipts
based
on
the
county
in
16


which
the
tax
was
collected,
a
city
shall
be
deemed
to
be
17


located
in
a
qualified
county
if
a
majority
of
the
population
18


of
the
city,
according
to
the
2010
federal
decennial
census,
19


resides
in
the
qualified
county.
20


The
bill
provides
that
in
a
qualified
county
a
city
or
the
21


board
of
supervisors
for
the
unincorporated
area
of
a
county
22


may
repeal
the
local
sales
and
services
tax
in
the
city
upon
23


adoption
of
its
own
motion
for
repeal.
24


For
those
counties
that
are
not
qualified
counties,
the
25


methods
of
seeking
presentment
of
the
local
option
sales
and
26


services
tax
to
the
voters
and
the
methods
for
repealing
such
27


a
tax
remain
the
same
as
required
under
current
Code
chapter
28


423B.
29


The
bill
provides
that
each
city
or
county
for

the
30


imposition
of
the
local
sales
and
services
tax
was
approved
at
31


election
on
