 17 10                           EXPLANATION
 17 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 13    This bill relates to water quality by increasing the
 17 14 sales and use tax rates, amending the natural resources and
 17 15 outdoor recreation trust fund, reducing individual income tax
 17 16 rates, creating a water service excise tax and related sales
 17 17 tax exemption, amending the wastewater treatment financial
 17 18 assistance program, and making appropriations.
 17 19    DIVISION I ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  Division I of the bill
 17 20 relates to state sales and use taxes and to an amendment to
 17 21 the Iowa Constitution ratified on November 2, 2010, which
 17 22 created a natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund
 17 23 (fund) and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the fund
 17 24 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality and
 17 25 natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and fish
 17 26 and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils in
 17 27 the state (Article VII, section 10).  The fund is codified in
 17 28 Code section 461.31.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount
 17 29 credited to the fund will be equal to the amount generated
 17 30 by an increase in the state sales tax rate occurring after
 17 31 the effective date of the constitutional amendment, but shall
 17 32 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
 17 33 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
 17 34 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
 17 35 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
 18  1 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
 18  2 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 17 10                           EXPLANATION
 17 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 13    This bill relates to water quality by increasing the
 17 14 sales and use tax rates, amending the natural resources and
 17 15 outdoor recreation trust fund, reducing individual income tax
 17 16 rates, creating a water service excise tax and related sales
 17 17 tax exemption, amending the wastewater treatment financial
 17 18 assistance program, and making appropriations.
 17 19    DIVISION I ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  Division I of the bill
 17 20 relates to state sales and use taxes and to an amendment to
 17 21 the Iowa Constitution ratified on November 2, 2010, which
 17 22 created a natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund
 17 23 (fund) and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the fund
 17 24 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality and
 17 25 natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and fish
 17 26 and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils in
 17 27 the state (Article VII, section 10).  The fund is codified in
 17 28 Code section 461.31.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount
 17 29 credited to the fund will be equal to the amount generated
 17 30 by an increase in the state sales tax rate occurring after
 17 31 the effective date of the constitutional amendment, but shall
 17 32 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
 17 33 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
 17 34 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
 17 35 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
 18  1 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
 18  2 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 17 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 13    This bill relates to water quality by increasing the
 17 14 sales and use tax rates, amending the natural resources and
 17 15 outdoor recreation trust fund, reducing individual income tax
 17 16 rates, creating a water service excise tax and related sales
 17 17 tax exemption, amending the wastewater treatment financial
 17 18 assistance program, and making appropriations.
 17 19    DIVISION I ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  Division I of the bill
 17 20 relates to state sales and use taxes and to an amendment to
 17 21 the Iowa Constitution ratified on November 2, 2010, which
 17 22 created a natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund
 17 23 (fund) and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the fund
 17 24 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality and
 17 25 natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and fish
 17 26 and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils in
 17 27 the state (Article VII, section 10).  The fund is codified in
 17 28 Code section 461.31.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount
 17 29 credited to the fund will be equal to the amount generated
 17 30 by an increase in the state sales tax rate occurring after
 17 31 the effective date of the constitutional amendment, but shall
 17 32 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
 17 33 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
 17 34 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
 17 35 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
 18  1 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
 18  2 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the

 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 17 19    DIVISION I ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  Division I of the bill
 17 20 relates to state sales and use taxes and to an amendment to
 17 21 the Iowa Constitution ratified on November 2, 2010, which
 17 22 created a natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund
 17 23 (fund) and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the fund
 17 24 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality and
 17 25 natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and fish
 17 26 and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils in
 17 27 the state (Article VII, section 10).  The fund is codified in
 17 28 Code section 461.31.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount
 17 29 credited to the fund will be equal to the amount generated
 17 30 by an increase in the state sales tax rate occurring after
 17 31 the effective date of the constitutional amendment, but shall
 17 32 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
 17 33 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
 17 34 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
 17 35 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
 18  1 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
 18  2 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in

 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing

 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but

 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 17 19    DIVISION I ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  Division I of the bill
 17 20 relates to state sales and use taxes and to an amendment to
 17 21 the Iowa Constitution ratified on November 2, 2010, which
 17 22 created a natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund
 17 23 (fund) and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the fund
 17 24 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality and
 17 25 natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and fish
 17 26 and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils in
 17 27 the state (Article VII, section 10).  The fund is codified in
 17 28 Code section 461.31.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount
 17 29 credited to the fund will be equal to the amount generated
 17 30 by an increase in the state sales tax rate occurring after
 17 31 the effective date of the constitutional amendment, but shall
 17 32 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
 17 33 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
 17 34 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
 17 35 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
 18  1 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
 18  2 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates

 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.

 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to

 17 19    DIVISION I ==== SALES AND USE TAXES.  Division I of the bill
 17 20 relates to state sales and use taxes and to an amendment to
 17 21 the Iowa Constitution ratified on November 2, 2010, which
 17 22 created a natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund
 17 23 (fund) and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the fund
 17 24 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality and
 17 25 natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and fish
 17 26 and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils in
 17 27 the state (Article VII, section 10).  The fund is codified in
 17 28 Code section 461.31.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount
 17 29 credited to the fund will be equal to the amount generated
 17 30 by an increase in the state sales tax rate occurring after
 17 31 the effective date of the constitutional amendment, but shall
 17 32 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
 17 33 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
 17 34 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
 17 35 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
 18  1 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
 18  2 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.

 17 32 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
 17 33 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
 17 34 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
 17 35 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
 18  1 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
 18  2 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same

 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the

 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The

 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 17 22 created a natural resources and outdoor recreation trust fund
 17 23 (fund) and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the fund
 17 24 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality and
 17 25 natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and fish
 17 26 and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils in
 17 27 the state (Article VII, section 10).  The fund is codified in
 17 28 Code section 461.31.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount
 17 29 credited to the fund will be equal to the amount generated
 17 30 by an increase in the state sales tax rate occurring after
 17 31 the effective date of the constitutional amendment, but shall
 17 32 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
 17 33 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
 17 34 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
 17 35 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
 18  1 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
 18  2 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.

 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 17 25 natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and fish
 17 26 and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils in
 17 27 the state (Article VII, section 10).  The fund is codified in
 17 28 Code section 461.31.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount
 17 29 credited to the fund will be equal to the amount generated
 17 30 by an increase in the state sales tax rate occurring after
 17 31 the effective date of the constitutional amendment, but shall
 17 32 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
 17 33 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
 17 34 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
 17 35 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
 18  1 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
 18  2 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the

 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount

 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 17 28 Code section 461.31.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount
 17 29 credited to the fund will be equal to the amount generated
 17 30 by an increase in the state sales tax rate occurring after
 17 31 the effective date of the constitutional amendment, but shall
 17 32 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
 17 33 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
 17 34 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
 17 35 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
 18  1 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
 18  2 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the

 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used

 17 31 the effective date of the constitutional amendment, but shall
 17 32 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
 17 33 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
 17 34 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
 17 35 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
 18  1 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
 18  2 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.

 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to

 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to

 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 17 31 the effective date of the constitutional amendment, but shall
 17 32 not exceed the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375
 17 33 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
 17 34 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
 17 35 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
 18  1 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
 18  2 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference

 17 33 percent would generate.  The state sales tax rate has not
 17 34 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
 17 35 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
 18  1 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
 18  2 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the

 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.

 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by

 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general

 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the

 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

       mm/rj/sc
 17 34 been increased since the effective date of the constitutional
 17 35 amendment, so no amounts have been credited to the fund.  The
 18  1 division increases the sales tax rate and the use tax rate
 18  2 from 6 percent to 6.125 percent on January 1, 2018, from 6.125
 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the

 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 18  3 percent to 6.25 percent on January 1, 2019, and from 6.25
 18  4 percent to 6.375 percent on January 1, 2020.  The division
 18  5 also amends the transfer of use tax revenues to the secure
 18  6 an advanced vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section
 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor

 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.

 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the

 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 18  7 423F.2 to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 18  8 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the

 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference

 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each

 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,

 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in

 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The

 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and

 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or

 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 18  9 use tax rate increases provided in the division.
 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 18 10    The division takes effect January 1, 2018.
 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The

 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy

 18 11    DIVISION II ==== INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAXES.  Division II relates
 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 18 12 to the individual income tax.  The division requires the
 18 13 department of revenue (department) to calculate the amount
 18 14 of sales and use tax revenue generated for each fiscal year
 18 15 from the increases in the sales and use tax rates provided in
 18 16 division I of the bill, and certify each fiscal year the amount
 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 18 17 to the governor and general assembly (certified amount).
 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the

 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality

 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to

 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to

 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 18 18    For each tax year beginning in the 12=year period of January
 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.

 18 19 1, 2018, through December 31, 2029, the division reduces the
 18 20 nine statutory individual income tax rates by an amount that
 18 21 will in the aggregate result in a reduction in individual
 18 22 income tax revenues equal to the certified amount for the
 18 23 fiscal year ending June 30 during the applicable tax year.  The
 18 24 required rate reduction is accomplished by reducing the income
 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each

 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.

 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the

 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or

 18 25 tax rates successively, starting with the lowest rate.  Each
 18 26 tax rate shall be reduced to zero before any remaining required
 18 27 rate reduction is applied to the next successive tax rate.  The
 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax

 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting

 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting

 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 18 28 tax rate reductions shall only apply to the tax year for which
 18 29 they are calculated, and future tax year tax rate reductions
 18 30 are applied to the statutory tax rates.  However, the tax rates
 18 31 determined for the tax year beginning January 1, 2029, shall
 18 32 become permanent and apply to all tax years beginning on or
 18 33 after that date.
 18 34    The division takes effect January 1, 2018, and applies to tax
 18 35 years beginning on or after that date.
 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting

 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.

 19  1 DIVISION III ==== WATER QUALITY PROGRAM AND WATER SERVICE
 19  2 EXCISE TAX.  Division III amends the wastewater treatment
 19  3 financial assistance program and creates a water service excise
 19  4 tax and related sales tax exemption.
 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.

 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 19  5    The division exempts from the state sales tax the sales
 19  6 price from the sale or furnishing by a water utility of a water
 19  7 service in the state to consumers or users. "Water service"
 19  8 and "water utility" are defined in the division.
 19  9    By operation of Code section 423.6, an item exempt from the
 19 10 imposition of the sales tax is also exempt from the use tax
 19 11 imposed in Code section 423.5.
 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting

 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
 20 31 effectiveness of the program every 10 years, beginning in 2026.
 20 32    DIVISION IV ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION.
 20 33  Division IV relates to the natural resources and outdoor
 20 34 recreation trust fund (Code chapter 461), which was enacted
 20 35 in 2010 to implement Article VII, section 10, of the Iowa
 21  1 Constitution.  The division requires that at least 60 percent
 21  2 of the moneys credited to the trust fund each fiscal year shall
 21  3 be expended exclusively to support research=based water quality
 21  4 initiatives under Code chapter 461 (spending threshold).  The
 21  5 division describes a research=based water quality initiative
 21  6 to include a practice that is described in the Iowa nutrient
 21  7 reduction strategy, as defined in the division, that has a
 21  8 life expectancy of more than 24 months, and that provides for
 21  9 multiple natural resource benefits.  If in any particular
 21 10 fiscal year the auditor of state determines that the spending
 21 11 threshold has not been met, the required spending threshold
 21 12 shall be increased in the following fiscal year to make up the
 21 13 deficiency.
 21 14    The division requires the heads of departments charged with
 21 15 making funding decisions with trust fund moneys to determine
 21 16 the amount of trust fund moneys that must be spent to satisfy
 21 17 the spending threshold each fiscal year, and to give preference
 21 18 to research=based water quality initiatives that would satisfy
 21 19 the spending threshold.
 21 20    The division prohibits trust fund moneys from being used
 21 21 as part of an activity that involves condemning property or
 21 22 otherwise exercising the power of eminent domain.

 19 12    The division creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent
 19 13 on the sales price from the sale or furnishing by a water
 19 14 utility of a water service in the state to consumers or users
 19 15 (Code chapter 423G).  The director of revenue is required to
 19 16 administer the water service tax as nearly as possible in
 19 17 conjunction with the administration of the state sales and
 19 18 use tax laws, and, to that end, the division incorporates by
 19 19 reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
 19 20 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
 19 21    Water service tax revenues are deposited in the general
 19 22 fund of the state and, after transferring one=sixth of the
 19 23 revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education fund
 19 24 in Code section 423F.2, the division requires an increasing
 19 25 portion of the remaining water service tax revenues collected
 19 26 each year to be transferred to the wastewater and drinking
 19 27 water treatment financial assistance fund to support the
 19 28 wastewater and drinking water treatment financial assistance
 19 29 program, as amended in the division and described below.
 19 30 Transfers to the fund initially equal one=sixth of the water
 19 31 service tax revenues collected on or after January 1, 2018, but
 19 32 before January 1, 2019, and increases to one=third, one=half,
 19 33 two=thirds, and five=sixths over the next four years. All
 19 34 water service tax revenues collected on or after January 1,
 19 35 2023, will be transferred to the fund.
 20  1 The water service tax is repealed January 1, 3031.
 20  2    The division amends the wastewater treatment financial
 20  3 assistance program administered by the Iowa finance authority
 20  4 (IFA) in Code section 16.134. Currently, the program provides
 20  5 financial assistance in the form of grants from IFA to
 20  6 disadvantaged communities to install or upgrade wastewater
 20  7 treatment facilities and systems, and for engineering or
 20  8 technical assistance for facility planning and design.  The
 20  9 division adds drinking water treatment facilities and systems,
 20 10 including source water protection projects, to the program.
 20 11 The division also removes the requirement that a community
 20 12 qualify as a disadvantaged community in order to receive
 20 13 financial assistance, instead providing that such disadvantaged
 20 14 communities shall receive priority under the program.  The
 20 15 division also modifies other priority designations under the
 20 16 program and modifies goals of the program, and provides that
 20 17 a utility management organization formed under Code chapter
 20 18 28E or operated by a rural water system organized under Code
 20 19 chapter 357A or 504 shall be considered eligible for financial
 20 20 assistance under the program.  The division also adds reporting
 20 21 and review requirements to the program, modifies the permitted
 20 22 use of fund moneys for administrative purposes, and creates
 20 23 a water quality financing review committee consisting of
 20 24 three members, as provided in the division, to review and
 20 25 approve applications for financial assistance under the
 20 26 program.  Finally, the division requires IFA to submit a
 20 27 report by October 1 of each year to the governor and general
 20 28 assembly detailing expenditures for the previous year under
 20 29 the program, and creates a program review committee consisting
 20 30 of eight members, as provided in the division, to review the
