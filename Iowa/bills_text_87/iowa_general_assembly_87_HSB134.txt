found

_____


person’s
comfortable
use
and
enjoyment
of
the
person’s
life
or
1


property
under
any
other
cause
of
action,
shall
not
exceed
the
2


following:
3


a.
The
person’s
share
of
compensatory
property
damages
due
4


to
any
diminution
in
the
fair
market
value
of
the
person’s
real
5


property
proximately
caused
by
the
animal
feeding
operation.
6


The
fair
market
value
of
the
real
property
is
deemed
to
equal
7


the
price
that
a
buyer
who
is
willing
but
not
compelled
to
8


buy
and
a
seller
who
is
willing
but
not
compelled
to
sell
9


would
accept
for
the
real
property.
The
person’s
share
of
any
10


compensatory
property
damages
must
be
based
on
the
person’s
11


share
of
the
ownership
interest
in
the
real
property.
For
12


purposes
of
this
section,
ownership
interest
means
holding
13


legal
or
equitable
title
to
real
property
in
fee
simple,
as
a
14


life
estate,
or
as
a
leasehold
interest.
15


b.
The
person’s
compensatory
damages
due
to
the
person’s
16


past,
present,
and
future
adverse
health
condition.
This
17


determination
shall
be
made
utilizing
only
objective
and
18


documented
medical
evidence
that
the
nuisance
or
interference
19


with
the
comfortable
use
and
enjoyment
of
the
person’s
life
or
20


property
was
the
proximate
cause
of
the
person’s
adverse
health
21


condition.
22


c.
The
person’s
compensatory
special
damages
proximately
23


caused
by
the
animal
feeding
operation,
including
without
24


limitation,
annoyance
and
the
loss
of
comfortable
use
and
25


enjoyment
of
real
property.
However,
the
total
damages
26


awarded
to
a
person
who
holds
an
ownership
interest
in
the
real
27


property
for
which
damages
are
awarded
under
this
paragraph
“c”
28


shall
not
exceed
one
and
one-half
times
the
sum
of
any
damages
29


awarded
to
the
person
for
the
person’s
share
of
the
total
30


compensatory
property
damages
awarded
under
paragraph
“a”
plus
31


any
compensatory
damages
awarded
to
the
person
under

32


“b”

to

or

The
cause
of
action
may
be
2


brought
under
Code
chapter
657,
which
addresses
private
and

public
nuisances,
or
under

law
principles.

FINDINGS
AND
PURPOSE.
The
bill
includes
general
assembly
5


findings
that
the
public’s
interests
are
advanced
by
preserving
6


and
encouraging
responsible
animal
agricultural
production,
7


and
states
the
bill’s
purpose
is
to
encourage
persons
involved
8


in
animal
agriculture
to
adopt
existing
prudent
and
generally
9


utilized
management
practices
for
their
animal
feeding
10


operations.
11


PRIVATE
AND
PUBLIC
NUISANCE.
An
affirmative
defense
may
be
12


raised
if
the
allegation
involves
either
a
private
or
public
13


nuisance.
A
private
nuisance
occurs
when
a
person
(defendant)
14


uses
the
person’s
land
in
a
manner
that
unreasonably
or
15


substantially
interferes
with
the
enjoyment
of
another
person
16


(plaintiff).
A
public
nuisance
unreasonably
and
substantially
17


interferes
with
the
public’s
use
and
enjoyment
of
legal
rights
18


common
to
the
public.
19


PERMANENT
AND
TEMPORARY
OR
CONTINUING
NUISANCES.
If
the
20


affirmative
defense
prevails,
the
animal
feeding
operation
is
21


conclusively
deemed
to
be
a
permanent
rather
than
a
temporary
22


or
continuing
nuisance.
A
temporary
or
continuing
nuisance
23


refers
to
an
injury
that
occurs
intermittently
and
which
may
24


be
the
basis
for
a
number
of
actions
for
damages
claimed
by
25


the
same
party.
A
permanent
nuisance
is
expected
to
continue
26


indefinitely
and
the
award
is
for
an
amount
equaling
the
total
27


resulting
damages,
including
future
damages
that
may
result
28


from
the
nuisance
as
it
then
exists.
29


LIMITATION
ON
DAMAGES.
The
affirmative
defense
limits


30


compensatory
damages
as
opposed
to
punitive
damages
proximately
31


caused
by
the
animal
feeding
operation
and
specifies
three
32


categories
of
awards,
including
(1)
damages
for
any
diminution
33


in
the
fair
market
value
of
a
person’s
real
property;
(2)
34


damages
due
to
a
person’s
past,
present,
and
future
adverse

1


damages
for
intangible
injuries
such
as
annoyance
or
the
loss
2


of
comfortable
use
and
enjoyment
of
real
property.
In
the
case
3


of
special
damages,
the
total
awarded
cannot
exceed
one
and
4


one-half
times
the
combined
amounts
for
property
damages
and
5


damages
resulting
from
an
adverse
health
condition.
6


COSTS.
A
party
who
alleges
and
fails
to
prove
that
an
7


animal
feeding
operation
is
a
public
or
private
nuisance
is
8


liable
to
pay
the
other
party
all
costs
and
expenses,
including
9


reasonable
attorney
fees
incurred
in
the
defense.
10


DATE
OF
OPERATION.
The
affirmative
defense
may
be
raised
11


regardless
of
the
established
date
of
operation
or
expansion
of
12


the
animal
feeding
operation.
13


EXCLUSIONS.
The
affirmative
defense
is
not
available
14


in
certain
circumstances:
(1)
an
animal
feeding
operation
15


failed
to
comply
with
an
applicable
federal
or
state
statute
16


or
regulation,
(2)
the
animal
feeding
operation
failed
to
17


use
existing
prudent
generally
utilized
management
practices
18


reasonable
for
the
animal
feeding
operation,
(3)
the
animal
19


feeding
operation
is
controlled
by
a
person
classified
as
a
20


habitual
violator
who
has
committed
three
or
more
environmental
21


violations,
and
(4)
the
cause
of
action

before
the
bill’s
22


effective
date.
