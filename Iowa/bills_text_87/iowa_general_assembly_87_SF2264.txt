  3 19 construction or operation of the confinement feeding operation
  3 20 or to manure application.
  3 21    The bill provides that the county may adopt the ordinance
  3 22 notwithstanding provisions in Code section 331.304A which
  3 23 prohibits a county from adopting legislation that regulates
  3 24 animal agriculture and Code section 335.2 which prohibits a
  3 25 county from adopting an ordinance that provides for the zoning
