The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
1


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
2


Currently,
a
government
entity
must
use
a
competitive
3


bidding
process
for
a
construction
project
when
that
project
4


is
estimated
to
cost
at
least
as
much
as
a
threshold
defined
5


in
Code
section
26.3.
This
bill
allows
a
government
entity
to
6


use
an
alternative
project
delivery
contract
in
circumstances
7


that
normally
require
the
government
entity
to
use
competitive
8


bidding
procedures.
The
bill
defines
a
government
entity
to
9


include
the
state
board
of
regents.
10


The
bill
creates
two
types
of
alternative
project
delivery
11


contracts,
each
with
specified
requirements.
The
first
12


alternative
is
the
design-build
contract,
which
can
select
13


design-builders
in
either
a
three-phase
or
two-phase
process.
14


In
the
three-phase
process,
the
government
entity
shall
first
15


request
statements
of
qualifications
from
design-builders.
16


The
government
entity
shall
select
at
least
two
but
no
more
17


than
five
qualified
design-builders
to
move
on
to
phases
two
18


and
three.
In
the
second
phase,
the
government
entity
shall
19


solicit
technical
proposals
and
conceptual
designs
from
the
20


remaining
design-builders.
The
government
entity
shall
pay
a
21


stipend
to
any
design-builder
that
participates
in
phase
two
22


but
whose
contract
the
entity
does
not
select.
The
third
phase
23


involves
the
design-builders
submitting
construction
costs.
24


The
government
entity
shall
award
points
for
each
proposal.
If
25


the
government
entity
chooses
to
award
a
contract,
it
shall
26


award
the
contract
to
the
design-builder
with
the
highest
point
27


total.


28


If
the
government
entity
uses
the
two-phase
process,
the
29


government
entity
will
request
qualifications
and
include
30


its
selection
criteria.
The
government
entity
will
rank
the
31


qualifications
of
a
design-builder.
In
the
second
phase,
the
32


government
entity
shall
negotiate
with
the
highest-ranked
33


design-builder.
If
the
two
parties
cannot
agree
to
a
contract
34


with
terms
and
conditions
acceptable

shall

That

shall

with

6


The
second
type
of
alternative
project
delivery
method
is
7


the
construction
manager-at-risk
contract.
If
a
government
8


entity
opts
to
use
a
construction
manager-at-risk
contract,
9


the
government
entity
shall
select
an
engineer
or

10


to
prepare
the
construction
documents
for
the
project.
That
11


engineer
or

cannot
serve
as
the

12


manager-at-risk.
The
government
entity
shall
use
a
two-phase
13


process
in
selecting
the
construction
manager-at-risk.
The
14


first
phase
shall
include
a
request
for
qualifications
and
15


the
government
entity’s
selection
criteria.
The
government
16


entity
may
select
and
interview
at
least
two
but
no
more
17


than
five
of
the
construction
managers-at-risk
who
submitted
18


qualifications
to
participate
in
the
second
phase,
based
solely
19


on
the
qualifications
of
those
construction
managers-at-risk.
20


In
phase
two,
the
construction
managers-at-risk
that
the
21


government
entity
selects
to
interview
will
provide
additional
22


information,
including
the
project
proposal,
costs,
and
23


fees.
The
government
entity
shall
rank
the
construction
24


managers-at-risk
in
a
manner
in
which
qualifications
account
25


for
at
least
40
percent
of
the
evaluation
and
cost
accounts
26


for
no
more
than
60
percent
of
the
evaluation.
The
government
27


entity
shall
select
the
construction
manager-at-risk
that
28


offers
the
best
value
based
on
the
evaluation
criteria.
If
29


the
two
parties
do
not
reach
an
agreement,
the
government
30


entity
shall
proceed
with
the
next
highest-ranked

manager-at-risk
and
follow
this
process
until
the
government
32


entity
reaches
a

with
a

The
