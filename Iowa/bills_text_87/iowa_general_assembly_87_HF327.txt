 12 27                           EXPLANATION
 12 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 30    GENERAL ==== STOCKPILING.  This bill amends three related
 12 31 Code chapters which in part regulate the stockpiling of that
 12 32 part of effluent produced by agricultural animals and which is
 12 33 characterized as "dry" or "solid" (referred to herein as "dry
 12 34 or solid manure") meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
 12 35 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
 13  1 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
 13  2 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 13  3 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 13  4 manure) and which originates from animal feeding operations.
 13  5 An animal feeding operation is where agricultural animals
 13  6 are confined and fed and maintained for at least 45 days.
 13  7 The regulations also apply to associated facilities and
 13  8 specifically animal truck wash facilities.
 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must

 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 12 27                           EXPLANATION
 12 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 30    GENERAL ==== STOCKPILING.  This bill amends three related
 12 31 Code chapters which in part regulate the stockpiling of that
 12 32 part of effluent produced by agricultural animals and which is
 12 33 characterized as "dry" or "solid" (referred to herein as "dry
 12 34 or solid manure") meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
 12 35 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
 13  1 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
 13  2 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 13  3 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 13  4 manure) and which originates from animal feeding operations.
 13  5 An animal feeding operation is where agricultural animals
 13  6 are confined and fed and maintained for at least 45 days.
 13  7 The regulations also apply to associated facilities and
 13  8 specifically animal truck wash facilities.
 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed

 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 12 11 dry bedded manure originates from a dry bedded confinement
 12 12 feeding operation that was constructed prior to January 1,
 12 13 2006.
 12 14    2.  The stockpiling requirements of the sections referred to
 12 15 in subsection 1 do apply to all of the following:
 12 16    a.  A stockpile where precipitation=induced runoff has
 12 17 drained away.
 12 18    b.  A stockpile consisting of dry bedded manure originated
 12 19 from a dry bedded confinement feeding operation that is
 12 20 expanded on or after January 1, 2006.
 12 21    Sec. 29.  CODE EDITOR DIRECTIVE.
 12 22    1.  The Code editor is directed to make the following
 12 23 transfer: section 459B.305 to section 459B.311.
 12 24    2.  The Code editor shall correct internal references in the
 12 25 Code and in any enacted legislation as necessary due to the
 12 26 enactment of this section.
 12 27                           EXPLANATION
 12 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 30    GENERAL ==== STOCKPILING.  This bill amends three related
 12 31 Code chapters which in part regulate the stockpiling of that
 12 32 part of effluent produced by agricultural animals and which is
 12 33 characterized as "dry" or "solid" (referred to herein as "dry
 12 34 or solid manure") meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
 12 35 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
 13  1 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
 13  2 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 13  3 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 13  4 manure) and which originates from animal feeding operations.
 13  5 An animal feeding operation is where agricultural animals
 13  6 are confined and fed and maintained for at least 45 days.
 13  7 The regulations also apply to associated facilities and
 13  8 specifically animal truck wash facilities.
 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that

 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 12 14    2.  The stockpiling requirements of the sections referred to
 12 15 in subsection 1 do apply to all of the following:
 12 16    a.  A stockpile where precipitation=induced runoff has
 12 17 drained away.
 12 18    b.  A stockpile consisting of dry bedded manure originated
 12 19 from a dry bedded confinement feeding operation that is
 12 20 expanded on or after January 1, 2006.
 12 21    Sec. 29.  CODE EDITOR DIRECTIVE.
 12 22    1.  The Code editor is directed to make the following
 12 23 transfer: section 459B.305 to section 459B.311.
 12 24    2.  The Code editor shall correct internal references in the
 12 25 Code and in any enacted legislation as necessary due to the
 12 26 enactment of this section.
 12 27                           EXPLANATION
 12 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 30    GENERAL ==== STOCKPILING.  This bill amends three related
 12 31 Code chapters which in part regulate the stockpiling of that
 12 32 part of effluent produced by agricultural animals and which is
 12 33 characterized as "dry" or "solid" (referred to herein as "dry
 12 34 or solid manure") meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
 12 35 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
 13  1 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
 13  2 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 13  3 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 13  4 manure) and which originates from animal feeding operations.
 13  5 An animal feeding operation is where agricultural animals
 13  6 are confined and fed and maintained for at least 45 days.
 13  7 The regulations also apply to associated facilities and
 13  8 specifically animal truck wash facilities.
 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a

 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in

 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same

 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 12 27                           EXPLANATION
 12 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 30    GENERAL ==== STOCKPILING.  This bill amends three related
 12 31 Code chapters which in part regulate the stockpiling of that
 12 32 part of effluent produced by agricultural animals and which is
 12 33 characterized as "dry" or "solid" (referred to herein as "dry
 12 34 or solid manure") meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
 12 35 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
 13  1 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
 13  2 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 13  3 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 13  4 manure) and which originates from animal feeding operations.
 13  5 An animal feeding operation is where agricultural animals
 13  6 are confined and fed and maintained for at least 45 days.
 13  7 The regulations also apply to associated facilities and
 13  8 specifically animal truck wash facilities.
 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that

 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable

 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or

 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in

 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 12 22    1.  The Code editor is directed to make the following
 12 23 transfer: section 459B.305 to section 459B.311.
 12 24    2.  The Code editor shall correct internal references in the
 12 25 Code and in any enacted legislation as necessary due to the
 12 26 enactment of this section.
 12 27                           EXPLANATION
 12 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 30    GENERAL ==== STOCKPILING.  This bill amends three related
 12 31 Code chapters which in part regulate the stockpiling of that
 12 32 part of effluent produced by agricultural animals and which is
 12 33 characterized as "dry" or "solid" (referred to herein as "dry
 12 34 or solid manure") meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
 12 35 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
 13  1 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
 13  2 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 13  3 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 13  4 manure) and which originates from animal feeding operations.
 13  5 An animal feeding operation is where agricultural animals
 13  6 are confined and fed and maintained for at least 45 days.
 13  7 The regulations also apply to associated facilities and
 13  8 specifically animal truck wash facilities.
 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 13  3 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 13  4 manure) and which originates from animal feeding operations.
 13  5 An animal feeding operation is where agricultural animals
 13  6 are confined and fed and maintained for at least 45 days.
 13  7 The regulations also apply to associated facilities and
 13  8 specifically animal truck wash facilities.
 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal

 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public

 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a

 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least

 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen

 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is

 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 12 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 30    GENERAL ==== STOCKPILING.  This bill amends three related
 12 31 Code chapters which in part regulate the stockpiling of that
 12 32 part of effluent produced by agricultural animals and which is
 12 33 characterized as "dry" or "solid" (referred to herein as "dry
 12 34 or solid manure") meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
 12 35 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
 13  1 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
 13  2 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 13  3 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 13  4 manure) and which originates from animal feeding operations.
 13  5 An animal feeding operation is where agricultural animals
 13  6 are confined and fed and maintained for at least 45 days.
 13  7 The regulations also apply to associated facilities and
 13  8 specifically animal truck wash facilities.
 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act

 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a

 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.

 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months

 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same

 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 12 27                           EXPLANATION
 12 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 12 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 30    GENERAL ==== STOCKPILING.  This bill amends three related
 12 31 Code chapters which in part regulate the stockpiling of that
 12 32 part of effluent produced by agricultural animals and which is
 12 33 characterized as "dry" or "solid" (referred to herein as "dry
 12 34 or solid manure") meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
 12 35 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
 13  1 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
 13  2 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 13  3 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 13  4 manure) and which originates from animal feeding operations.
 13  5 An animal feeding operation is where agricultural animals
 13  6 are confined and fed and maintained for at least 45 days.
 13  7 The regulations also apply to associated facilities and
 13  8 specifically animal truck wash facilities.
 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding

 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal

 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public

 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January

 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an

 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that

 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 12 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 12 30    GENERAL ==== STOCKPILING.  This bill amends three related
 12 31 Code chapters which in part regulate the stockpiling of that
 12 32 part of effluent produced by agricultural animals and which is
 12 33 characterized as "dry" or "solid" (referred to herein as "dry
 12 34 or solid manure") meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
 12 35 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
 13  1 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
 13  2 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 13  3 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 13  4 manure) and which originates from animal feeding operations.
 13  5 An animal feeding operation is where agricultural animals
 13  6 are confined and fed and maintained for at least 45 days.
 13  7 The regulations also apply to associated facilities and
 13  8 specifically animal truck wash facilities.
 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a

 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or

 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an

 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.

 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 12 32 part of effluent produced by agricultural animals and which is
 12 33 characterized as "dry" or "solid" (referred to herein as "dry
 12 34 or solid manure") meaning that it does not flow perceptibly
 12 35 under pressure and is not capable of being transported through
 13  1 a mechanical pumping device designed to move a liquid (Code
 13  2 sections 459.102 which refers to dry manure, 459A.102 which
 13  3 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 13  4 manure) and which originates from animal feeding operations.
 13  5 An animal feeding operation is where agricultural animals
 13  6 are confined and fed and maintained for at least 45 days.
 13  7 The regulations also apply to associated facilities and
 13  8 specifically animal truck wash facilities.
 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 13  5 An animal feeding operation is where agricultural animals
 13  6 are confined and fed and maintained for at least 45 days.
 13  7 The regulations also apply to associated facilities and
 13  8 specifically animal truck wash facilities.
 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 13  4 manure) and which originates from animal feeding operations.
 13  5 An animal feeding operation is where agricultural animals
 13  6 are confined and fed and maintained for at least 45 days.
 13  7 The regulations also apply to associated facilities and
 13  8 specifically animal truck wash facilities.
 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where

 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 13  3 refers to solids, and 459B.102 which refers to dry bedded
 13  4 manure) and which originates from animal feeding operations.
 13  5 An animal feeding operation is where agricultural animals
 13  6 are confined and fed and maintained for at least 45 days.
 13  7 The regulations also apply to associated facilities and
 13  8 specifically animal truck wash facilities.
 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a

 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or

 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months

 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed

 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that

 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or

 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 13  5 An animal feeding operation is where agricultural animals
 13  6 are confined and fed and maintained for at least 45 days.
 13  7 The regulations also apply to associated facilities and
 13  8 specifically animal truck wash facilities.
 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed

 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that

 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.

 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a

 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in

 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 13  9    GENERAL ==== AMENDED CHAPTERS.  The bill amends provisions
 13 10 regulating stockpiles in Code chapters 459A and 459B to be
 13 11 the same as or similar as provisions regulating stockpiles
 13 12 contained in Code chapter 459.  Code chapter 459 ("Animal
 13 13 Agriculture Compliance Act") regulates all animal feeding
 13 14 operations but primarily confinement feeding operations where
 13 15 agricultural animals are confined to areas which are totally
 13 16 roofed.  Code chapter 459A ("Animal Agriculture Compliance Act
 13 17 for Open Feedlot Operations and Animal Truck Wash Facilities")
 13 18 regulates open feedlot operations which are unroofed or
 13 19 partially roofed areas where there is no vegetation, and
 13 20 where settleable solids are separated from liquids; and
 13 21 animal truck wash facilities that are used to store effluent
 13 22 including solids after truck=trailers transporting agricultural
 13 23 animals are cleaned.  Code chapter 459B ("Animal Agriculture
 13 24 Compliance Act for Dry Bedded Confinement Feeding Operations")
 13 25 regulates special confinement feeding operations (e.g., hooped
 13 26 structures) in which the effluent is exclusively stored on a
 13 27 dry rather than liquid basis.
 13 28    ALLOWANCE.  The bill provides that a person may stockpile dry
 13 29 or solid manure, so long as it complies with legal statutory
 13 30 requirements and rules adopted by the department of natural
 13 31 resources, including provisions which refer to the federal
 13 32 Clean Water Act.
 13 33    AIR QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 13 34 establishes separation distance requirements established
 13 35 between a stockpile and a residence not owned by the
 14  1 titleholder of the land, a commercial enterprise, a bona fide
 14  2 religious institution, an educational institution, or a public
 14  3 use area.
 14  4    AIR QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The bill provides exceptions
 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the

 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to

 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In

 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to

 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially

 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.

 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 14  5 from separation distance requirements in cases where a
 14  6 titleholder of land benefiting from the separation distance
 14  7 signs a waiver, the dry or solid manure originates from a small
 14  8 animal feeding operation or small animal truck wash facility,
 14  9 or the operation or facility was established prior to January
 14 10 1, 2006.
 14 11    WATER QUALITY == CONSOLIDATION.  The bill provides that two
 14 12 stockpiles separated by 1,250 feet or less are considered a
 14 13 single stockpile.
 14 14    WATER QUALITY ==== GENERAL.  The bill requires a person
 14 15 stockpiling dry or solid manure to comply with applicable
 14 16 requirements of the federal Water Pollution Control Act.  In
 14 17 addition, the dry or solid manure must not be disposed of in a
 14 18 manner that will cause surface water or groundwater pollution.
 14 19    WATER QUALITY ==== SEPARATION DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS.  The bill
 14 20 establishes separation distances between a stockpile and a
 14 21 designated area (sinkhole, cistern, abandoned well, unplugged
 14 22 agricultural drainage well, agricultural drainage well surface
 14 23 inlet, drinking water well, a designated wetland, or a water
 14 24 source) and a high=quality water resource.  A stockpile
 14 25 also cannot be located on land having a slope of more than 3
 14 26 percent, unless measures are installed to prevent runoff.
 14 27    WATER QUALITY ==== NONKARST AND KARST TERRAIN.  The bill
 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
 15 28 civil penalties based on a number of criteria established
 15 29 by the department.  The civil penalty cannot exceed $10,000
 15 30 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.602).  A person who violates
 15 31 a provision regulating water quality is subject to an
 15 32 administratively assessed civil penalty of not more than
 15 33 $10,000 (Code sections 455B.109 and 459.603), or a judicially
 15 34 assessed amount of not more than $5,000 per each day of the
 15 35 violation (Code sections 455B.191 and 459.603).
 16  1 The bill provides that a person stockpiling dry manure from
 16  2 an open feedlot operation or an animal truck wash facility who
 16  3 violates the new air quality provision is subject to the same
 16  4 civil penalty that applies to a person stockpiling dry manure
 16  5 from a confinement feeding operation.  Otherwise, the person is
 16  6 subject to the same civil penalty as applies to water quality
 16  7 regulations applicable to confinement feeding operations.  A
 16  8 person stockpiling dry manure from a dry bedded confinement
 16  9 feeding operation is subject to the same civil penalties that
 16 10 apply to confinement feeding operations violating air or water
 16 11 quality regulations.

 14 28 prohibits a person from stockpiling dry manure on terrain,
 14 29 other than karst terrain, for more than 15 consecutive days
 14 30 unless the person uses a roofed structure (qualified stockpile
 14 31 structure) or other barrier (qualified stockpile cover).  If a
 14 32 cover is used to store dry or solid manure on a long=term basis
 14 33 (more than six months in any two=year period) the ground or
 14 34 flooring must be composed on nonpermeable materials.  If the
 14 35 stockpile is located on karst terrain, there must be at least
 15  1 a five=foot barrier between the bottom of the stockpile and
 15  2 the underlying limestone, dolomite, or other soluble rock.  In
 15  3 addition, if the dry or solid manure is stockpiled for more
 15  4 than 15 days, a qualified stockpile structure or qualified
 15  5 stockpile cover must be used.  If a cover is used to store
 15  6 dry or solid manure on a long=term basis, the stockpile must
 15  7 be located on reinforced concrete at least five inches thick.
 15  8 The bill eliminates a provision in Code chapter 459 which
 15  9 requires a stockpile inspection statement be filed with the
 15 10 department.  The bill eliminates a provision which applies
 15 11 the same requirements to dry bedded manure stockpiled in an
 15 12 alluvial aquifer.
 15 13    WATER QUALITY ==== APPLICATION PRACTICES.  The bill requires
 15 14 that dry or solid manure must be removed within six months
 15 15 after it is first stockpiled. It also requires a person to
 15 16 apply the dry or solid manure in the same manner as required in
 15 17 Code chapter 459, including on snow=covered ground or frozen
 15 18 ground and in close proximity to a designated area.
 15 19    WATER QUALITY ==== EXCEPTIONS.  The provisions of the bill
 15 20 which establish water quality regulations do not apply to
 15 21 operations or facilities constructed prior to January 1, 2006,
 15 22 unless they are expanded. These exceptions do not apply to
 15 23 provisions prohibiting water pollution.
 15 24    CIVIL PENALTIES.  Under Code chapter 459, different civil
 15 25 penalties apply to violations involving air quality and water
 15 26 quality.  A person who violates a provision regulating air
 15 27 quality is subject to a range of administratively assessed
