  5 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 23    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related

  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.
  6 24    This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.

  6 31 community adolescent pregnancy prevention grant program.
  6 32    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 16 held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions

  5 20                           EXPLANATION
  5 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 23    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.
  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.
  6 24    This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
  6 25    Division II of the bill relates to the distribution and use

  6 29 Health Services Act, the personal responsibility education
  6 30 program, the abstinence education grant program, and the
  6 31 community adolescent pregnancy prevention grant program.
  6 32    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.

  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during

  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.

  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 13                          SEVERABILITY
  5 14    Sec. 7.  SEVERABILITY.  If any provision of this Act or
  5 15 the application of this Act to any person or circumstances is
  5 16 held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions

  5 19 provisions of this Act are severable.
  5 20                           EXPLANATION
  5 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 23    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.
  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.
  6 24    This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
  6 25    Division II of the bill relates to the distribution and use
  6 26 of certain federal funds for abortions. The division includes
  6 27 limitations on distribution to certain applicants of federal

  6 29 Health Services Act, the personal responsibility education
  6 30 program, the abstinence education grant program, and the
  6 31 community adolescent pregnancy prevention grant program.
  6 32    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.

  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during

  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.

  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,

  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance

  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions

  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 20                           EXPLANATION
  5 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 23    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.
  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.
  6 24    This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
  6 25    Division II of the bill relates to the distribution and use

  6 29 Health Services Act, the personal responsibility education
  6 30 program, the abstinence education grant program, and the
  6 31 community adolescent pregnancy prevention grant program.
  6 32    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall

  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region

  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,

  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance

  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that

  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.

  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during

  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 20                           EXPLANATION
  5 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 23    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.
  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.
  6 24    This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
  6 25    Division II of the bill relates to the distribution and use
  6 26 of certain federal funds for abortions. The division includes
  6 27 limitations on distribution to certain applicants of federal
  6 28 funds received by the state under Title X of the federal Public
  6 29 Health Services Act, the personal responsibility education
  6 30 program, the abstinence education grant program, and the
  6 31 community adolescent pregnancy prevention grant program.
  6 32    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)

  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related

  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.
  6 24    This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
  6 25    Division II of the bill relates to the distribution and use

  6 29 Health Services Act, the personal responsibility education
  6 30 program, the abstinence education grant program, and the
  6 31 community adolescent pregnancy prevention grant program.
  6 32    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.

  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.

  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report

  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that

  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent

  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 20                           EXPLANATION
  5 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 23    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.
  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.
  6 24    This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
  6 25    Division II of the bill relates to the distribution and use
  6 26 of certain federal funds for abortions. The division includes
  6 27 limitations on distribution to certain applicants of federal
  6 28 funds received by the state under Title X of the federal Public
  6 29 Health Services Act, the personal responsibility education
  6 30 program, the abstinence education grant program, and the
  6 31 community adolescent pregnancy prevention grant program.
  6 32    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)

  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.

  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.

  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of

  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.

  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.

  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance

  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that

  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 20                           EXPLANATION
  5 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 23    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.
  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.
  6 24    This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
  6 25    Division II of the bill relates to the distribution and use

  6 31 community adolescent pregnancy prevention grant program.
  6 32    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall

  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe

  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.

  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,

  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance

  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions

  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)

  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate

  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that

  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent

  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 20                           EXPLANATION
  5 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 23    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.
  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.
  6 24    This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
  6 25    Division II of the bill relates to the distribution and use
  6 26 of certain federal funds for abortions. The division includes
  6 27 limitations on distribution to certain applicants of federal
  6 28 funds received by the state under Title X of the federal Public
  6 29 Health Services Act, the personal responsibility education
  6 30 program, the abstinence education grant program, and the
  6 31 community adolescent pregnancy prevention grant program.
  6 32    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.

  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during

  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region

  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to

  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.

  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region

  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 20                           EXPLANATION
  5 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 23    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.
  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.
  6 24    This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
  6 25    Division II of the bill relates to the distribution and use

  6 29 Health Services Act, the personal responsibility education
  6 30 program, the abstinence education grant program, and the
  6 31 community adolescent pregnancy prevention grant program.
  6 32    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related

  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of

  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.

  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,

  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.

  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the

  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.

  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the

  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,

  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.

  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have

  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee

  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during

  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are

  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.

  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,

  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that

  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of

  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the

  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the

  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible

  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have

  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.
  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of

  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,

  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.

  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have

  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 23    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.
  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.
  6 24    This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
  6 25    Division II of the bill relates to the distribution and use
  6 26 of certain federal funds for abortions. The division includes

  6 29 Health Services Act, the personal responsibility education
  6 30 program, the abstinence education grant program, and the
  6 31 community adolescent pregnancy prevention grant program.
  6 32    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.

  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe

  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,

  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,

  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that

  7 34 abortions are performed.

  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related

  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe

  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance

  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report

  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region

  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 20                           EXPLANATION
  5 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 23    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.
  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.

  6 31 community adolescent pregnancy prevention grant program.
  6 32    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that

  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.

  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.

  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,

  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance

  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have

  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 20                           EXPLANATION
  5 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 23    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.
  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.
  6 24    This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
  6 25    Division II of the bill relates to the distribution and use

  6 29 Health Services Act, the personal responsibility education
  6 30 program, the abstinence education grant program, and the
  6 31 community adolescent pregnancy prevention grant program.
  6 32    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that

  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family

  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.

  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,

  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.

  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe

  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,

  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family

  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that

  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall

  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during

  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family

  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that

  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.

  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region

  5 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 23    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.
  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.
  6 24    This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.

  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the

  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.

  5 20                           EXPLANATION
  5 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 23    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.
  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.
  6 24    This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
  6 25    Division II of the bill relates to the distribution and use

  6 31 community adolescent pregnancy prevention grant program.
  6 32    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have
  8  3 standing to intervene on behalf of the general assembly as a
  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any
  8  7 provision or application of the bill that is held invalid from
  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that

  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not

  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of

  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to

  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the

  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the

  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors

  5 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 23    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning
  5 27 network waiver.
  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.
  6 12    The division requires DHS to submit a report to the governor
  6 13 and the general assembly annually by January 1 listing any
  6 14 entities that received program funds that are in the lowest
  6 15 position of priority described as nonpublic entities that
  6 16 provide family planning services but do not provide required
  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe
  6 22 limitation or elimination of access to family planning services
  6 23 in the region of the state where the entity is located.
  6 24    This division of the bill takes effect upon enactment.
  6 25    Division II of the bill relates to the distribution and use

  6 31 community adolescent pregnancy prevention grant program.
  6 32    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  6 33 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  6 34 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a
  6 35 prioritized schedule of applicants.  The division prohibits
  7  1 funding to be distributed to any entity that performs abortions
  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are
  7  3 performed.  The division also prohibits funds distributed to
  7  4 be used for direct or indirect costs related to providing
  7  5 abortions.  The division makes exceptions to the definition
  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  7 20 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  7 21 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  7 22 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  7 23 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 24 are performed.
  7 25    The division directs the department of human services,
  7 26 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  7 27 2017, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance
  7 28 for needy families block grant funds appropriated to the
  7 29 department for the community adolescent pregnancy prevention
  7 30 and services program, any  applicant entity that provides
  7 31 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  7 32 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
  7 33 provides abortions or maintains or operates a facility where
  7 34 abortions are performed.
  7 35    Division III of the bill provides for a right of
  8  1 intervention.  The bill provides that a sponsor or cosponsors
  8  2 of the bill, as an agent or agents of the state, shall have

  8  4 party in any judicial or administrative proceeding challenging
  8  5 the provisions of the bill.
  8  6    Division IV of the bill provides for severability of any

  8  8 the provisions or applications of the bill which can be given
  8  9 effect without the invalid provisions or application.

  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to

  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe

  7  2 or that maintains or operates a facility where abortions are

  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the

  7 34 abortions are performed.

  5 24 relative to abortions.
  5 25    Division I of the bill establishes a state family planning
  5 26 services program and discontinues the Medicaid family planning

  5 28    The division directs the department of human services (DHS)
  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family
  5 31 planning services program.  The state program is to replicate
  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that
  6  2 continues access to family planning services, but are not to
  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related
  6 11 to providing abortions.

  6 17 primary health services as defined in federal law, as well as
  6 18 the amount and type of funds received by such entities during
  6 19 the preceding calendar year.  The report is also to include a
  6 20 detailed explanation of how DHS determined that distribution of
  6 21 program funds to such an entity was necessary to prevent severe

  7  6 of "abortion" for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  7  7 The division directs DPH to submit a report annually to the
  7  8 governor and the general assembly by January 1, identifying any
  7  9 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  7 10 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
  7 16    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  7 17 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, to administer the
  7 18 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  7 19 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible

  5 29 to discontinue the Medicaid family planning network waiver
  5 30 effective July 1, 2017, and to instead establish a state family

  5 32 the eligibility requirements and other provisions included in
  5 33 the Medicaid family planning network waiver, but the program
  5 34 funds are to be distributed in accordance with a prioritization
  5 35 schedule specified in the division.
  6  1 The program funds are to be distributed in a manner that

  6  3 be distributed to any entity that performs abortions or that
  6  4 maintains or operates a facility where abortions are performed.
  6  5 The division makes exceptions to the definition of "abortion"
  6  6 for the purpose of distribution of the funds.
  6  7    The division also specifies that the funds distributed shall
  6  8 not be used for direct or indirect costs, including but not
  6  9 limited to administrative costs or expenses, overhead, employee
  6 10 salaries, rent, and telephone and other utility costs, related

  7 11 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  7 12 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  7 13 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  7 14 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  7 15 of the state where the entity is located.
