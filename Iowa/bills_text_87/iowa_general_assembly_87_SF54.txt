  3 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 11    This bill relates to the determination of when fetal death
  3 12 and homicide and related criminal provisions apply to a fetus.
  3 13    The bill redefines "stillbirth" and "spontaneous termination
  3 14 of pregnancy", and describes fetal death for the purposes of
  3 15 the required filing of a fetal death certificate, so that all
  3 16 these terms are based on the fetus' weight relative to 350
  3 17 grams.
  3 18    The bill defines the term "person" in the context of the
  3 19 victim of a murder to mean an individual human being from the

  3 22 that murder does not include a stillbirth, a fetal death, or a
  3 23 spontaneous termination of pregnancy.
  3 24    The bill also amends provisions relating to feticide
  3 25 to apply the elements of that crime to a human pregnancy

  3 27 the alternative of application to a fetus after the second
  3 28 trimester of a pregnancy.
  3 29    The bill amends provisions relating to the murder of a fetus
  3 30 aborted alive and the duty to preserve the life of a fetus on
  3 31 which a termination of pregnancy has been induced or performed,
  3 32 to apply to a fetus that has reached the weight of 350 grams
  3 33 or more rather than a fetus that has reached the stage of
  3 34 viability.
  3 35    The criminal penalties that currently apply to murder,
  4  1 feticide, nonconsensual termination of a human pregnancy,
  4  2 murder of a fetus aborted alive, and violation of the duty to
  4  3 preserve the life of a fetus, are applicable, respectively, to
