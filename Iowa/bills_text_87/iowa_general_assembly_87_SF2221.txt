  2 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 12    This bill requires the department of human services (DHS)

  2 16    The bill provides that if a managed care organization (MCO)
  2 17 fails to pay, contest, deny, or settle a clean claim in full
  2 18 within the time frame established by the managed care contract,
  2 19 the MCO  is required to pay the claimant interest equal to 18
  2 20 percent per annum on the total amount of the claim ultimately
  2 21 authorized as calculated from 15 days after the date the claim
  2 22 was submitted.  For claims ultimately found to be incorrectly
  2 23 denied or underpaid through an appeals process or audit, an MCO
  2 24 is required to pay, in addition to the amount determined to be
  2 25 owed, interest of 18 percent per annum on the total amount of
  2 26 the claim authorized.
  2 27    The bill requires an MCO to provide written notice to all

  2 32    The bill requires an MCO to pay, contest, or deny a claim,
  2 33 in whole or in part, within 45 business days after receipt of
  2 34 the claim.  If a claim is contested or denied, the managed
  2 35 care organization shall, with as much specificity as possible,
  3  1 identify the claim or portion of the claim affected, provide
  3  2 an explanation and the reasons for contesting or denying the
  3  3 claim, and provide the claimant with instruction for appeal of
  3  4 the claim.
  3  5    The bill requires an MCO to complete the internal review
  3  6 process for any claim submitted within 90 business days of
  3  7 receipt of the request for internal review.  If the internal
  3  8 review is not completed within the 90=day period, the claim is
  3  9 subject to contested case review pursuant to Code chapter 17A,
  3 10 notwithstanding the fact that the claimant has not exhausted
  3 11 the managed care organization's internal review process and
  3 12 received a final written determination from the MCO.

  2 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 12    This bill requires the department of human services (DHS)
  2 13 to  adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed
  2 14 care contracts to require compliance with various policies and
  2 15 procedures.
  2 16    The bill provides that if a managed care organization (MCO)
  2 17 fails to pay, contest, deny, or settle a clean claim in full
  2 18 within the time frame established by the managed care contract,
  2 19 the MCO  is required to pay the claimant interest equal to 18
  2 20 percent per annum on the total amount of the claim ultimately
  2 21 authorized as calculated from 15 days after the date the claim
  2 22 was submitted.  For claims ultimately found to be incorrectly
  2 23 denied or underpaid through an appeals process or audit, an MCO
  2 24 is required to pay, in addition to the amount determined to be
  2 25 owed, interest of 18 percent per annum on the total amount of
  2 26 the claim authorized.
  2 27    The bill requires an MCO to provide written notice to all
  2 28 affected individuals at least 30 days prior to a change in any
  2 29 term of a managed care contract or agreement upon which an
  2 30 affected individual has relied under the Medicaid managed care
  2 31 program.
  2 32    The bill requires an MCO to pay, contest, or deny a claim,
  2 33 in whole or in part, within 45 business days after receipt of
  2 34 the claim.  If a claim is contested or denied, the managed
  2 35 care organization shall, with as much specificity as possible,
  3  1 identify the claim or portion of the claim affected, provide
  3  2 an explanation and the reasons for contesting or denying the
  3  3 claim, and provide the claimant with instruction for appeal of
  3  4 the claim.
  3  5    The bill requires an MCO to complete the internal review
  3  6 process for any claim submitted within 90 business days of
  3  7 receipt of the request for internal review.  If the internal
  3  8 review is not completed within the 90=day period, the claim is
  3  9 subject to contested case review pursuant to Code chapter 17A,
  3 10 notwithstanding the fact that the claimant has not exhausted
  3 11 the managed care organization's internal review process and
  3 12 received a final written determination from the MCO.
