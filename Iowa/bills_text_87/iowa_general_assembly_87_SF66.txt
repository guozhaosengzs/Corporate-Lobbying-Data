  4 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 13    This bill prohibits an employer from denying a reasonable
  4 14 accommodation in the terms, conditions, or privileges of
  4 15 employment to a job applicant or employee based on the
  4 16 employee's or applicant's pregnancy, childbirth, or related
  4 17 medical condition upon request, unless the employer can
  4 18 demonstrate that providing the accommodation would impose an
  4 19 undue hardship on the employer.
  4 20    The bill prohibits an employer from retaliating or taking
  4 21 adverse action against an employee who requests or uses such a
  4 22 reasonable accommodation.
  4 23    The bill prohibits an employer from denying employment
  4 24 opportunities to a job applicant or employee if such denial is
  4 25 based on the need of the employer to make such a reasonable
  4 26 accommodation.
  4 27    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring a job
  4 28 applicant or employee affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or a
  4 29 related medical condition to accept an accommodation that the
  4 30 applicant or employee declines to accept.
  4 31    The bill prohibits an employer from requiring an employee
  4 32 to take employment leave if another reasonable accommodation
  4 33 can be provided pursuant to the bill without undue hardship to
  4 34 the employer.
  4 35    The bill prohibits an employer from making an inquiry
  5  1 prior to employment regarding a job applicant's pregnancy,
  5  2 childbirth, or related medical condition.
  5  3    The bill defines "reasonable accommodation" to include but
  5  4 not be limited to more frequent or longer breaks, time off
  5  5 to recover from childbirth, acquisition or modification of
  5  6 equipment, performance of job duties while seated, temporary
  5  7 transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position, job
  5  8 restructuring, light duty, break time and private non=bathroom
  5  9 space for expressing breast milk, assistance with manual labor,
  5 10 or modified work schedules.
  5 11    The bill defines "related medical condition" to include but
  5 12 not be limited to lactation or the need to express breast milk
  5 13 for a nursing child.
  5 14    The bill defines "adverse action" as any action that might
  5 15 dissuade a reasonable employee from engaging in activities
  5 16 protected under Code chapter 216 and specifies that "adverse
  5 17 action" includes but is not limited to failing to reinstate the
  5 18 employee to the employee's original job or to an equivalent
  5 19 position with equivalent pay and accumulated seniority,
  5 20 retirement, fringe benefits, and other applicable service
  5 21 credits when the employee's need for a reasonable accommodation
  5 22 ceases.
  5 23    The bill defines "undue hardship" as an action requiring
  5 24 significant difficulty or expense.
  5 25    The bill requires an employer to engage in a timely,
  5 26 good=faith, and interactive process with an employee to
  5 27 determine effective reasonable accommodations pursuant to the
  5 28 bill.
  5 29    The bill specifies that an employer shall have the burden
  5 30 of proving undue hardship under the bill. The bill provides
  5 31 a nonexclusive list of factors to be considered by the civil
  5 32 rights commission in making such a determination. The bill
  5 33 specifies that an employer who provides or would be required to
  5 34 provide a similar accommodation to another class of employees
  5 35 that requires such accommodation shall create a rebuttable
  6  1 presumption that the accommodation does not impose an undue
  6  2 hardship on the employer.
  6  3    The bill requires an employer to post written notice of the
  6  4 right to be free from discrimination in relation to pregnancy,
  6  5 childbirth, or a related medical condition, including the
  6  6 right to reasonable accommodations and a private, secure,
  6  7 and sanitary space and break time to express breast milk for
  6  8 a nursing child, conspicuously at the employer's place of
  6  9 business in an area accessible to employees. The bill also
  6 10 requires such notice to be provided to new employees, existing
  6 11 employees by January 1, 2018, and any employee who notifies the
  6 12 employer of the employee's pregnancy.
  6 13    The bill requires the civil rights commission to develop
  6 14 courses of instruction and conduct ongoing public education
  6 15 efforts as necessary to inform employers, employees, employment
  6 16 agencies, and job applicants regarding their rights and
  6 17 responsibilities under the bill.
  6 18    The preceding provisions of the bill shall not be construed
  6 19 to narrow or restrict any other provision of law relating to
  6 20 sex discrimination or pregnancy, or to diminish any right or
  6 21 responsibility thereunder.
  6 22    The bill requires an employer to provide to an employee a
  6 23 private, secure, and sanitary space and break time to express
  6 24 breast milk for a nursing child.
  6 25    Under current law, a written or unwritten employment policy
  6 26 or practice which excludes from employment applicants or
  6 27 employees because of the employee's pregnancy is a prima facie
  6 28 violation of Code chapter 216. The bill removes the phrase
  6 29 "prima facie," so that such employment policies or practices
  6 30 are violations of Code chapter 216.
  6 31    The bill states that it is the intent of the general
  6 32 assembly that a violation of Code section 216.6, subsection 2,
  6 33 which governs employment policies relating to pregnancy and
  6 34 childbirth, constitutes an unfair or discriminatory practice
  6 35 in violation of Code chapter 216, subject to the processes
  7  1 and remedies set forth in Code chapter 216, and further, that
  7  2 the burden=shifting analysis articulated by the United States
  7  3 supreme court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792

  5 34 provide a similar accommodation to another class of employees
  5 35 that requires such accommodation shall create a rebuttable
  6  1 presumption that the accommodation does not impose an undue
  6  2 hardship on the employer.
  6  3    The bill requires an employer to post written notice of the

  6  5 childbirth, or a related medical condition, including the
  6  6 right to reasonable accommodations and a private, secure,
  6  7 and sanitary space and break time to express breast milk for
  6  8 a nursing child, conspicuously at the employer's place of
  6  9 business in an area accessible to employees. The bill also
