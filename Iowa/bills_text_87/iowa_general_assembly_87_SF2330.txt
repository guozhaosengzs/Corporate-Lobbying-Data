  1 19    h.  It is an unlawful practice for a person to sell,
  1 20 lease, rent, or advertise the sale, lease, or rental of a
  1 21 water treatment system in this state, for which claims or
  1 22 representations of removing health=related contaminants
  1 23 are made, unless the water treatment system has all claims
  1 24 or representations of removing health=related contaminants
  1 25 certified by a certification body accredited by the American
  1 26 national standards institute. This paragraph shall not be
  1 27 construed as limiting a manufacturer's ability to make claims
  1 28 or representations of removing contaminants that are not
  1 29 health=related contaminants.
  1 30    Sec. 5.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act takes effect January 1,
  1 31 2019.
  1 32    Sec. 6.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies on or after the
  1 33 effective date of this Act to the sales, leases, and rentals
  1 34 of water treatment systems, and the advertisement of the sale,
  1 35 lease, or rental of a water treatment system, which occur on
  2  1 or after that date.
  2  2                           EXPLANATION
  2  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  5    This bill relates to the sale, lease, rental, or
  2  6 advertisement of water treatment systems.
  2  7    Under current law, it is an unlawful practice for a person to
  2  8 sell, lease, rent, or advertise the sale, lease, or rental of a
  2  9 water treatment system for which claims or representations of
  2 10 removing health=related contaminants are made, unless the water
  2 11 treatment system is performance tested by a third=party testing
  2 12 agency authorized by the department of public health or the
  2 13 manufacturer tested the system and the manufacturer's data is
  2 14 accepted by a third=party evaluator which was approved by the
  2 15 department of public health; the water treatment system has met
  2 16 the performance testing requirements specified in the testing
  2 17 protocol; the water treatment system bears a label stating,
  2 18 "IMPORTANT NOTICE == Read the Manufacturer's Performance Data
  2 19 Sheet" and is accompanied by the manufacturer's performance
  2 20 data sheet, which includes general information about the
  2 21 water treatment system and performance and test data showing
  2 22 the contaminants certified to be reduced; and the consumer
  2 23 information pamphlet compiled by the department of public
  2 24 health is included with the water treatment system.
  2 25    Under Code section 714.16, the attorney general may
  2 26 investigate a person the attorney general believes is engaged
  2 27 in an unlawful practice and seek and obtain injunctive relief
  2 28 against such a person. Code section 714.16 also permits a
  2 29 court to impose a civil penalty against a person who committed
  2 30 an unlawful practice.
  2 31    The bill amends the requirements so that the sale, lease,
  2 32 rental, or advertisement of a water treatment system is not an
  2 33 unlawful practice if the claims and representations related
  2 34 to removal of health=related contaminants are certified by
  2 35 a certification body accredited by the American national
  3  1 standards institute.
  3  2    The bill eliminates the requirements that a consumer
  3  3 of a water treatment system be provided the manufacturer's
  3  4 performance data sheet or a consumer information pamphlet
  3  5 compiled by the department of public health.
  3  6    The bill does not affect Code section 714.16(2)(i) or Code
  3  7 section 714.16(2)(j), both of which also relate to the sale,
  3  8 lease, rental, or advertisement of a water treatment system.
  3  9 Under Code section 714.16(2)(i), it is an unlawful practice for
  3 10 a person to sell, lease, rent, or advertise a water treatment
  3 11 system in this state for which false or deceptive claims or
  3 12 representations of removing health=related contaminants are
  3 13 made. Under Code section 714.16(2)(j), it is an unlawful
  3 14 practice for a person to make any representation or claim
  3 15 that the seller's water treatment system has been approved or
  3 16 endorsed by any agency of the state.
  3 17    The bill takes effect January 1, 2019, and applies to the
  3 18 sales, leases, rentals, or advertisements of water treatment
  3 19 systems which occur on or after that date.

  1 12 for which a maximum contaminant level or treatment technique
  1 13 requirement or an action level established in lieu of a maximum

  1 16    Sec. 4.  Section 714.16, subsection 2, paragraph h, Code
  1 17 2018, is amended by striking the paragraph and inserting in
  1 18 lieu thereof the following:
