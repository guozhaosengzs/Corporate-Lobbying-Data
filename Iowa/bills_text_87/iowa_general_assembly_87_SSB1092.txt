The

if
the
public
11


corporation

a

improvement
project
in
a
fund
16


for
the

of
labor,
materials,
25


service,
or
transportation
to
a
general
contractor
must
give
26


only
one
type
of
notice,
along
with
a
certified
statement
that
27


such
notice
was
given.
28


Current
Code
section
573.16
provides
that
even
if
a
claimant
29


has
commenced
an
action
for
payment
of
funds,
the
public
30


corporation
shall
release
the
unpaid
funds
to
the
contractor
if
31


the
contractor
files
a
surety
bond
in
double
the
amount
of
the
32


claim
in
controversy,
conditioned
upon
the
