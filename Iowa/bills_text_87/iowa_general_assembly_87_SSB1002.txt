EXPLANATION
3


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
4


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
5


This
bill
eliminates
the
provision
that
prohibits
a
peace
6


officer
from
stopping
or
detaining
a
person
solely
for
a
7


violation
of
Code
section
321.276,
which
relates
to
texting
8


while
driving.
9


The
scheduled
fine
for
a
violation
of
Code
section
321.276
10


remains
$30.
Under
current
law,
the
offense
is
not
a
moving
11


violation,
and
therefore
cannot
be
considered
for
purposes
12


of
administrative
suspension
of
a
driver’s
license
or
for
13


establishing
habitual
offender
status.
However,
if
the
14


violation
causes
a
serious
injury,
a
court
could
impose
an
15


additional
fine
of
$500
or
suspend
the
person’s
driver’s
16


license
for
not
more
than
90
days,
or
both.
If
the
violation
17


causes
a
death,
a
court
could
impose
an
additional
fine
of
18


$1,000
or
suspend
the
person’s
driver’s
license
for
not
more
19


than
180
days,
or
both.
