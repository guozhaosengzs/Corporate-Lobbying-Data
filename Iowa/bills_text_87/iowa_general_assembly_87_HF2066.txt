  1  1    Section 1.    1  1    Section 1.    1  2 expungement.
  1  3    1.  Upon application of a defendant convicted of a simple
  1  4 misdemeanor, the court shall enter an order expunging the

  1  9 convicted of or granted a deferred judgment for a criminal

  1 18    3.  This section applies to a simple misdemeanor conviction
  1 19 that occurred prior to, on, or after July 1, 2018.
  1 20    4.  Notwithstanding section 692.2, after receipt of

  1 26                           EXPLANATION
  1 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 29    This bill relates to the expungement of a simple misdemeanor
  1 30 offense.
  1 31    The term "expunged" means the court's criminal record with

  1 33 that has been segregated in a secure area or database which is
  1 34 exempt from public access.
  1 35    The bill provides that upon the application of a defendant
  2  1 convicted of a simple misdemeanor, the court shall enter an
  2  2 order expunging the record of such criminal case as a matter

  2 12 under Code sections 123.46 (consumption or intoxication in

  2 15 for both offenses, and does not apply to simple misdemeanor
  2 16 convictions for domestic abuse assault under Code section
  2 17 708.2A.
  2 18    The bill applies to a simple misdemeanor conviction that
  2 19 occurs prior to, on, or after July 1, 2018.
