  4 24 entered into on or after July 1, 2018, to administer the
  4 25 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  4 26 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible

  4 24 entered into on or after July 1, 2018, to administer the
  4 25 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  4 26 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible

  3 30    This bill relates to the distribution of certain funds
  3 31 relative to abortions.
  3 32    Division I of the bill relates to the distribution and use

  4  4    The division directs the department of health (DPH) to
  4  5 distribute all grant funding received through Title X of
  4  6 the federal Public Health Services Act on the basis of a

  4 16 entities lowest in the prioritization schedule that received
  4 17 public funds instead of an entity higher in the prioritization
  4 18 schedule during the preceding calendar year. The report
  4 19 shall include a detailed explanation of how DPH determined
  4 20 that distribution to such an entity was necessary to prevent
  4 21 limitations in access to family planning services in the region
  4 22 of the state where the entity is located.
  4 23    The division directs DPH, beginning with any contract
  4 24 entered into on or after July 1, 2018, to administer the
  4 25 state personal responsibility education program and the state
  4 26 abstinence education grant program to exclude as an eligible
  4 27 applicant any applicant entity that provides abortions,
  4 28 maintains or operates facilities where abortions are performed,
  4 29 or regularly makes referrals to an entity that provides
  4 30 abortions or maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  4 31 are performed.
  4 32    The division directs the department of human services,
  4 33 beginning with any contract entered into on or after July 1,
  4 34 2018, to exclude from the award of federal temporary assistance

  5  3 abortions, maintains or operates a facility where abortions
  5  4 are performed, or regularly makes referrals to an entity that
