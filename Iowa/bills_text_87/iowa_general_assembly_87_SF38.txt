 45 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 45 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 45 15    This bill relates to state taxes by repealing the individual
 45 16 income tax and increasing the state sales and use tax rates.
 45 17    Division I repeals the individual income tax and makes
 45 18 numerous conforming changes to the Code to remove references
 45 19 to the individual income tax and to update or move provisions
 45 20 of the individual income tax that are also applicable by
 45 21 reference to the corporate income tax and the franchise tax.
 45 22 The division also repeals the emergency medical services income
 45 23 surtax in Code chapter 422D, the instructional support income
 45 24 surtax in Code section 257.21, the educational improvement
 45 25 income surtax in Code section 257.29, and the physical plant
 45 26 and equipment income surtax in Code section 298.2, because
 45 27 income surtax revenues will no longer be generated without the
 45 28 state individual income tax.
 45 29    The repeal of the individual income tax will also affect the
 45 30 industrial new jobs training program in Code chapter 260E, the
 45 31 accelerated career education program in Code chapter 260G, and
 45 32 the targeted jobs withholding credit in Code section 403.19A,
 45 33 because those programs rely on income tax amounts withheld from
 45 34 employee wages by employers.
 45 35    The division provides that additional legislation is
 46  1 required to fully implement the division and requires the
 46  2 director of the department of revenue to prepare draft
 46  3 legislation in compliance with Code section 2.16 for submission
 46  4 to the legislative services agency to implement the repeal of
 46  5 the individual income tax.

 46  7 years beginning on or after that date.
 46  8    Division II increases the state sales and use tax rate to
 46  9 11 percent from 6 percent. By operation of law as provided in
 46 10 Article VII, section 10 of the Iowa Constitution, a portion
 46 11 (0.375 percent) of the state sales tax generated and collected
 46 12 from the rate increase provided in this division will be
 46 13 transferred to the natural resources and outdoor recreation
 46 14 trust fund in Code section 461.31.  The division amends the
 46 15 transfer of state sales tax revenues to the secure an advanced
 46 16 vision for education fund (SAVE) in Code section 423F.2 from
 46 17 one=sixth (approximately 16.66 percent) of the revenues to
 46 18 17.2548 percent of the revenues to ensure that SAVE receives
 46 19 approximately the same proportion of the total sales tax
 46 20 revenue as it did prior to the sales tax rate increase provided
 46 21 in the division.
