  6 17    2.  The rights and remedies available under this chapter are

  6 20                           EXPLANATION
  6 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 23    This bill places restrictions on third parties that
  6 24 receive student data from a school district, accredited
  6 25 nonpublic school, or area education agency; and on operators
  6 26 of internet sites, online services, online applications, and
  6 27 mobile applications designed, marketed, and used primarily
  6 28 for kindergarten through grade 12 (K=12) school purposes.  A
  6 29 violation of any of the restrictions is an unlawful practice
  6 30 pursuant to Code section 714.16, a prohibited practice or act
  6 31 under Code section 714H.3, and, in addition, the attorney
  6 32 general may bring a civil action on behalf of an injured
  6 33 person.
  6 34    PROHIBITIONS AND DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS.  The bill prohibits
  6 35 an operator from engaging in targeted advertising that is
  7  1 based on or derived from information the operator acquired
  7  2 through the operator's internet site, service, or application;
  7  3 from using information created or gathered by the operator's
  7  4 internet site, service, or application, to amass a profile
  7  5 about a student enrolled in a K=12 school in this state except
  7  6 in furtherance of school purposes; and from selling a student's
  7  7 information, though this prohibition does not apply to the
  7  8 purchase, merger, or other type of acquisition of an operator
  7  9 by another entity, provided that the operator or successor
  7 10 entity continues to be subject to the restrictions relating to
  7 11 previously acquired student information.
  7 12    The operator is also prohibited from disclosing covered
  7 13 information unless the disclosure is in furtherance of the K=12
  7 14 school purposes and the recipient of the covered information is
  7 15 subject to similar restrictions.  Disclosure is also authorized
  7 16 in order to ensure legal and regulatory compliance, to respond
  7 17 to or participate in judicial process, or to protect the
  7 18 safety of the internet site users or persons identified on the
  7 19 internet site or security of the internet site.
  7 20    The operator may also disclose covered information to a
  7 21 service provider if the operator implements and maintains
  7 22 reasonable security procedures and practices, and, if the
  7 23 service provider is contractually prohibited from using any
  7 24 of the information for any purpose other than providing the
  7 25 contracted service to, or on behalf of, the operator, and from
  7 26 disclosing any covered information provided by the operator to
  7 27 subsequent third parties.
  7 28    However, these prohibitions shall not be construed to
  7 29 prohibit the operator's use of information for maintaining,
  7 30 developing, supporting, improving, or diagnosing the operator's
  7 31 internet site, service, or application.
  7 32    The operator is required to implement and maintain
  7 33 reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the
  7 34 nature of the covered information, and protect that information
  7 35 from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or
  8  1 disclosure; and to delete a student's covered information if
  8  2 the school district, accredited nonpublic school, or area
  8  3 education agency requests deletion of data under the control of
  8  4 the school district, school, or area education agency.
  8  5    Notwithstanding the disclosure prohibitions, as long as the
  8  6 operator does not violate the provisions prohibiting targeting
  8  7 advertising, the use of student information to amass a profile,
  8  8 and the sale of student information, an operator may disclose
  8  9 covered information of a student if other provisions of federal
  8 10 or state law require the operator to disclose the information,
  8 11 or for legitimate research purposes as required by and subject
  8 12 to state or federal law and under the direction of the school
  8 13 district, school, or area education agency; and to state or
  8 14 local educational agencies as permitted by state or federal
  8 15 law.
  8 16    The bill shall not be construed to prohibit an operator
  8 17 from using deidentified student covered information to improve
  8 18 educational products or to demonstrate the effectiveness of
  8 19 the operator's products or services and their marketing; to
  8 20 prohibit an operator from sharing aggregated deidentified
  8 21 student covered information for the development and improvement
  8 22 of educational internet sites, services, or applications; to
  8 23 limit a law enforcement agency from obtaining information
  8 24 as authorized by law or court order; to limit the ability
  8 25 of an operator to use student data for adaptive learning or
  8 26 customized student learning purposes; to apply to general
  8 27 audience internet sites, general audience online services,
  8 28 general audience online applications, or general audience
  8 29 mobile applications; to restrict internet service providers
  8 30 from providing internet connectivity to schools or students
  8 31 and their families; to prohibit an operator from marketing
  8 32 educational products directly to parents so long as the
  8 33 marketing did not result from the use of covered information;
  8 34 to impose a duty upon a provider of an electronic store,
  8 35 gateway, marketplace, or other means of purchasing or
  9  1 downloading software or applications to review or enforce
  9  2 compliance with applicable restrictions by such software
  9  3 or applications; to impose a duty upon a provider of an
  9  4 interactive computer service to review or enforce compliance
  9  5 by third=party content providers; or to impede the ability of
  9  6 students to download, export, or otherwise save or maintain
  9  7 their own student=created data or documents.
  9  8    REMEDIES.  The bill provides that a violation of new Code
  9  9 chapter 715D is a prohibited practice or act under Code section
  9 10 714H.3, providing for a private right of action for a person
  9 11 who suffers an ascertainable loss of money or property as the
  9 12 result of a prohibited practice or act, allowing the person to
  9 13 bring an action at law to recover actual damages and to seek
  9 14 court protection from further violations including temporary
  9 15 and permanent injunctive relief.
  9 16    The bill provides that a violation of new Code chapter 715D
  9 17 is an unlawful practice pursuant to Code section 714.16. In
  9 18 addition to the remedies provided to the attorney general
  9 19 pursuant to Code section 714.16(7), the attorney general may
  9 20 seek and obtain an order that a party held to violate the
  9 21 chapter pay damages to the attorney general on behalf of a
  9 22 person injured by the violation.  The rights and remedies
  9 23 available are cumulative to each other and to any other rights
  9 24 and remedies available under the law.

  6 20                           EXPLANATION
  6 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 23    This bill places restrictions on third parties that
  6 24 receive student data from a school district, accredited
  6 25 nonpublic school, or area education agency; and on operators
  6 26 of internet sites, online services, online applications, and
  6 27 mobile applications designed, marketed, and used primarily
  6 28 for kindergarten through grade 12 (K=12) school purposes.  A
  6 29 violation of any of the restrictions is an unlawful practice
  6 30 pursuant to Code section 714.16, a prohibited practice or act
  6 31 under Code section 714H.3, and, in addition, the attorney
  6 32 general may bring a civil action on behalf of an injured
  6 33 person.
  6 34    PROHIBITIONS AND DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS.  The bill prohibits
  6 35 an operator from engaging in targeted advertising that is
  7  1 based on or derived from information the operator acquired
  7  2 through the operator's internet site, service, or application;
  7  3 from using information created or gathered by the operator's
  7  4 internet site, service, or application, to amass a profile
  7  5 about a student enrolled in a K=12 school in this state except
  7  6 in furtherance of school purposes; and from selling a student's
  7  7 information, though this prohibition does not apply to the
  7  8 purchase, merger, or other type of acquisition of an operator
  7  9 by another entity, provided that the operator or successor
  7 10 entity continues to be subject to the restrictions relating to
  7 11 previously acquired student information.
  7 12    The operator is also prohibited from disclosing covered
  7 13 information unless the disclosure is in furtherance of the K=12
  7 14 school purposes and the recipient of the covered information is
  7 15 subject to similar restrictions.  Disclosure is also authorized
  7 16 in order to ensure legal and regulatory compliance, to respond
  7 17 to or participate in judicial process, or to protect the
  7 18 safety of the internet site users or persons identified on the
  7 19 internet site or security of the internet site.
  7 20    The operator may also disclose covered information to a
  7 21 service provider if the operator implements and maintains
  7 22 reasonable security procedures and practices, and, if the
  7 23 service provider is contractually prohibited from using any
  7 24 of the information for any purpose other than providing the
  7 25 contracted service to, or on behalf of, the operator, and from
  7 26 disclosing any covered information provided by the operator to
  7 27 subsequent third parties.
  7 28    However, these prohibitions shall not be construed to
  7 29 prohibit the operator's use of information for maintaining,
  7 30 developing, supporting, improving, or diagnosing the operator's
  7 31 internet site, service, or application.
  7 32    The operator is required to implement and maintain
  7 33 reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the
  7 34 nature of the covered information, and protect that information
  7 35 from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or
  8  1 disclosure; and to delete a student's covered information if
  8  2 the school district, accredited nonpublic school, or area
  8  3 education agency requests deletion of data under the control of
  8  4 the school district, school, or area education agency.
  8  5    Notwithstanding the disclosure prohibitions, as long as the
  8  6 operator does not violate the provisions prohibiting targeting
  8  7 advertising, the use of student information to amass a profile,
  8  8 and the sale of student information, an operator may disclose
  8  9 covered information of a student if other provisions of federal
  8 10 or state law require the operator to disclose the information,
  8 11 or for legitimate research purposes as required by and subject
  8 12 to state or federal law and under the direction of the school
  8 13 district, school, or area education agency; and to state or
  8 14 local educational agencies as permitted by state or federal
  8 15 law.
  8 16    The bill shall not be construed to prohibit an operator
  8 17 from using deidentified student covered information to improve
  8 18 educational products or to demonstrate the effectiveness of
  8 19 the operator's products or services and their marketing; to
  8 20 prohibit an operator from sharing aggregated deidentified
  8 21 student covered information for the development and improvement
  8 22 of educational internet sites, services, or applications; to
  8 23 limit a law enforcement agency from obtaining information
  8 24 as authorized by law or court order; to limit the ability
  8 25 of an operator to use student data for adaptive learning or
  8 26 customized student learning purposes; to apply to general
  8 27 audience internet sites, general audience online services,
  8 28 general audience online applications, or general audience
  8 29 mobile applications; to restrict internet service providers
  8 30 from providing internet connectivity to schools or students
  8 31 and their families; to prohibit an operator from marketing
  8 32 educational products directly to parents so long as the
  8 33 marketing did not result from the use of covered information;
  8 34 to impose a duty upon a provider of an electronic store,
  8 35 gateway, marketplace, or other means of purchasing or
  9  1 downloading software or applications to review or enforce
  9  2 compliance with applicable restrictions by such software
  9  3 or applications; to impose a duty upon a provider of an
  9  4 interactive computer service to review or enforce compliance
  9  5 by third=party content providers; or to impede the ability of
  9  6 students to download, export, or otherwise save or maintain
  9  7 their own student=created data or documents.
  9  8    REMEDIES.  The bill provides that a violation of new Code
  9  9 chapter 715D is a prohibited practice or act under Code section
  9 10 714H.3, providing for a private right of action for a person
  9 11 who suffers an ascertainable loss of money or property as the
  9 12 result of a prohibited practice or act, allowing the person to
  9 13 bring an action at law to recover actual damages and to seek
  9 14 court protection from further violations including temporary
  9 15 and permanent injunctive relief.
  9 16    The bill provides that a violation of new Code chapter 715D

  9 20 seek and obtain an order that a party held to violate the

  6 17    2.  The rights and remedies available under this chapter are
  6 18 cumulative to each other and to any other rights and remedies
  6 19 available under the law.
  6 20                           EXPLANATION
  6 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 23    This bill places restrictions on third parties that
  6 24 receive student data from a school district, accredited
  6 25 nonpublic school, or area education agency; and on operators
  6 26 of internet sites, online services, online applications, and
  6 27 mobile applications designed, marketed, and used primarily
  6 28 for kindergarten through grade 12 (K=12) school purposes.  A
  6 29 violation of any of the restrictions is an unlawful practice
  6 30 pursuant to Code section 714.16, a prohibited practice or act
  6 31 under Code section 714H.3, and, in addition, the attorney
  6 32 general may bring a civil action on behalf of an injured
  6 33 person.
  6 34    PROHIBITIONS AND DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS.  The bill prohibits
  6 35 an operator from engaging in targeted advertising that is
  7  1 based on or derived from information the operator acquired
  7  2 through the operator's internet site, service, or application;
  7  3 from using information created or gathered by the operator's
  7  4 internet site, service, or application, to amass a profile
  7  5 about a student enrolled in a K=12 school in this state except
  7  6 in furtherance of school purposes; and from selling a student's
  7  7 information, though this prohibition does not apply to the
  7  8 purchase, merger, or other type of acquisition of an operator
  7  9 by another entity, provided that the operator or successor
  7 10 entity continues to be subject to the restrictions relating to
  7 11 previously acquired student information.
  7 12    The operator is also prohibited from disclosing covered
  7 13 information unless the disclosure is in furtherance of the K=12
  7 14 school purposes and the recipient of the covered information is
  7 15 subject to similar restrictions.  Disclosure is also authorized
  7 16 in order to ensure legal and regulatory compliance, to respond
  7 17 to or participate in judicial process, or to protect the
  7 18 safety of the internet site users or persons identified on the
  7 19 internet site or security of the internet site.
  7 20    The operator may also disclose covered information to a
  7 21 service provider if the operator implements and maintains
  7 22 reasonable security procedures and practices, and, if the
  7 23 service provider is contractually prohibited from using any
  7 24 of the information for any purpose other than providing the
  7 25 contracted service to, or on behalf of, the operator, and from
  7 26 disclosing any covered information provided by the operator to
  7 27 subsequent third parties.
  7 28    However, these prohibitions shall not be construed to
  7 29 prohibit the operator's use of information for maintaining,
  7 30 developing, supporting, improving, or diagnosing the operator's
  7 31 internet site, service, or application.
  7 32    The operator is required to implement and maintain
  7 33 reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the
  7 34 nature of the covered information, and protect that information
  7 35 from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or
  8  1 disclosure; and to delete a student's covered information if
  8  2 the school district, accredited nonpublic school, or area
  8  3 education agency requests deletion of data under the control of
  8  4 the school district, school, or area education agency.
  8  5    Notwithstanding the disclosure prohibitions, as long as the
  8  6 operator does not violate the provisions prohibiting targeting
  8  7 advertising, the use of student information to amass a profile,
  8  8 and the sale of student information, an operator may disclose
  8  9 covered information of a student if other provisions of federal
  8 10 or state law require the operator to disclose the information,
  8 11 or for legitimate research purposes as required by and subject
  8 12 to state or federal law and under the direction of the school
  8 13 district, school, or area education agency; and to state or
  8 14 local educational agencies as permitted by state or federal
  8 15 law.
  8 16    The bill shall not be construed to prohibit an operator
  8 17 from using deidentified student covered information to improve
  8 18 educational products or to demonstrate the effectiveness of
  8 19 the operator's products or services and their marketing; to
  8 20 prohibit an operator from sharing aggregated deidentified
  8 21 student covered information for the development and improvement
  8 22 of educational internet sites, services, or applications; to
  8 23 limit a law enforcement agency from obtaining information
  8 24 as authorized by law or court order; to limit the ability
  8 25 of an operator to use student data for adaptive learning or
  8 26 customized student learning purposes; to apply to general
  8 27 audience internet sites, general audience online services,
  8 28 general audience online applications, or general audience
  8 29 mobile applications; to restrict internet service providers
  8 30 from providing internet connectivity to schools or students
  8 31 and their families; to prohibit an operator from marketing
  8 32 educational products directly to parents so long as the
  8 33 marketing did not result from the use of covered information;
  8 34 to impose a duty upon a provider of an electronic store,
  8 35 gateway, marketplace, or other means of purchasing or
  9  1 downloading software or applications to review or enforce
  9  2 compliance with applicable restrictions by such software
  9  3 or applications; to impose a duty upon a provider of an
  9  4 interactive computer service to review or enforce compliance
  9  5 by third=party content providers; or to impede the ability of
  9  6 students to download, export, or otherwise save or maintain
  9  7 their own student=created data or documents.

  9  9 chapter 715D is a prohibited practice or act under Code section
  9 10 714H.3, providing for a private right of action for a person

  9 13 bring an action at law to recover actual damages and to seek
  9 14 court protection from further violations including temporary
  9 15 and permanent injunctive relief.
  9 16    The bill provides that a violation of new Code chapter 715D

  9 20 seek and obtain an order that a party held to violate the

  6 20                           EXPLANATION
  6 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 23    This bill places restrictions on third parties that
  6 24 receive student data from a school district, accredited
  6 25 nonpublic school, or area education agency; and on operators
  6 26 of internet sites, online services, online applications, and
  6 27 mobile applications designed, marketed, and used primarily
  6 28 for kindergarten through grade 12 (K=12) school purposes.  A
  6 29 violation of any of the restrictions is an unlawful practice
  6 30 pursuant to Code section 714.16, a prohibited practice or act
  6 31 under Code section 714H.3, and, in addition, the attorney
  6 32 general may bring a civil action on behalf of an injured
  6 33 person.
  6 34    PROHIBITIONS AND DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS.  The bill prohibits
  6 35 an operator from engaging in targeted advertising that is
  7  1 based on or derived from information the operator acquired
  7  2 through the operator's internet site, service, or application;
  7  3 from using information created or gathered by the operator's
  7  4 internet site, service, or application, to amass a profile
  7  5 about a student enrolled in a K=12 school in this state except
  7  6 in furtherance of school purposes; and from selling a student's
  7  7 information, though this prohibition does not apply to the
  7  8 purchase, merger, or other type of acquisition of an operator
  7  9 by another entity, provided that the operator or successor
  7 10 entity continues to be subject to the restrictions relating to
  7 11 previously acquired student information.
  7 12    The operator is also prohibited from disclosing covered
  7 13 information unless the disclosure is in furtherance of the K=12
  7 14 school purposes and the recipient of the covered information is
  7 15 subject to similar restrictions.  Disclosure is also authorized
  7 16 in order to ensure legal and regulatory compliance, to respond
  7 17 to or participate in judicial process, or to protect the
  7 18 safety of the internet site users or persons identified on the
  7 19 internet site or security of the internet site.
  7 20    The operator may also disclose covered information to a
  7 21 service provider if the operator implements and maintains
  7 22 reasonable security procedures and practices, and, if the
  7 23 service provider is contractually prohibited from using any
  7 24 of the information for any purpose other than providing the
  7 25 contracted service to, or on behalf of, the operator, and from
  7 26 disclosing any covered information provided by the operator to
  7 27 subsequent third parties.
  7 28    However, these prohibitions shall not be construed to
  7 29 prohibit the operator's use of information for maintaining,
  7 30 developing, supporting, improving, or diagnosing the operator's
  7 31 internet site, service, or application.
  7 32    The operator is required to implement and maintain
  7 33 reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the
  7 34 nature of the covered information, and protect that information
  7 35 from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or
  8  1 disclosure; and to delete a student's covered information if
  8  2 the school district, accredited nonpublic school, or area
  8  3 education agency requests deletion of data under the control of
  8  4 the school district, school, or area education agency.
  8  5    Notwithstanding the disclosure prohibitions, as long as the
  8  6 operator does not violate the provisions prohibiting targeting
  8  7 advertising, the use of student information to amass a profile,
  8  8 and the sale of student information, an operator may disclose
  8  9 covered information of a student if other provisions of federal
  8 10 or state law require the operator to disclose the information,
  8 11 or for legitimate research purposes as required by and subject
  8 12 to state or federal law and under the direction of the school
  8 13 district, school, or area education agency; and to state or
  8 14 local educational agencies as permitted by state or federal
  8 15 law.
  8 16    The bill shall not be construed to prohibit an operator
  8 17 from using deidentified student covered information to improve
  8 18 educational products or to demonstrate the effectiveness of
  8 19 the operator's products or services and their marketing; to
  8 20 prohibit an operator from sharing aggregated deidentified
  8 21 student covered information for the development and improvement
  8 22 of educational internet sites, services, or applications; to
  8 23 limit a law enforcement agency from obtaining information
  8 24 as authorized by law or court order; to limit the ability
  8 25 of an operator to use student data for adaptive learning or
  8 26 customized student learning purposes; to apply to general
  8 27 audience internet sites, general audience online services,
  8 28 general audience online applications, or general audience
  8 29 mobile applications; to restrict internet service providers
  8 30 from providing internet connectivity to schools or students
  8 31 and their families; to prohibit an operator from marketing
  8 32 educational products directly to parents so long as the
  8 33 marketing did not result from the use of covered information;
  8 34 to impose a duty upon a provider of an electronic store,
  8 35 gateway, marketplace, or other means of purchasing or
  9  1 downloading software or applications to review or enforce
  9  2 compliance with applicable restrictions by such software
  9  3 or applications; to impose a duty upon a provider of an
  9  4 interactive computer service to review or enforce compliance
  9  5 by third=party content providers; or to impede the ability of
  9  6 students to download, export, or otherwise save or maintain
  9  7 their own student=created data or documents.
  9  8    REMEDIES.  The bill provides that a violation of new Code
  9  9 chapter 715D is a prohibited practice or act under Code section
  9 10 714H.3, providing for a private right of action for a person
  9 11 who suffers an ascertainable loss of money or property as the

  9 13 bring an action at law to recover actual damages and to seek
  9 14 court protection from further violations including temporary
  9 15 and permanent injunctive relief.
  9 16    The bill provides that a violation of new Code chapter 715D

  9 19 pursuant to Code section 714.16(7), the attorney general may
  9 20 seek and obtain an order that a party held to violate the

  9 22 person injured by the violation.  The rights and remedies
  9 23 available are cumulative to each other and to any other rights

  6 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 23    This bill places restrictions on third parties that
  6 24 receive student data from a school district, accredited
  6 25 nonpublic school, or area education agency; and on operators
  6 26 of internet sites, online services, online applications, and
  6 27 mobile applications designed, marketed, and used primarily
  6 28 for kindergarten through grade 12 (K=12) school purposes.  A
  6 29 violation of any of the restrictions is an unlawful practice
  6 30 pursuant to Code section 714.16, a prohibited practice or act
  6 31 under Code section 714H.3, and, in addition, the attorney
  6 32 general may bring a civil action on behalf of an injured
  6 33 person.
  6 34    PROHIBITIONS AND DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS.  The bill prohibits
  6 35 an operator from engaging in targeted advertising that is
  7  1 based on or derived from information the operator acquired
  7  2 through the operator's internet site, service, or application;
  7  3 from using information created or gathered by the operator's
  7  4 internet site, service, or application, to amass a profile
  7  5 about a student enrolled in a K=12 school in this state except
  7  6 in furtherance of school purposes; and from selling a student's
  7  7 information, though this prohibition does not apply to the
  7  8 purchase, merger, or other type of acquisition of an operator
  7  9 by another entity, provided that the operator or successor
  7 10 entity continues to be subject to the restrictions relating to
  7 11 previously acquired student information.
  7 12    The operator is also prohibited from disclosing covered
  7 13 information unless the disclosure is in furtherance of the K=12
  7 14 school purposes and the recipient of the covered information is
  7 15 subject to similar restrictions.  Disclosure is also authorized
  7 16 in order to ensure legal and regulatory compliance, to respond
  7 17 to or participate in judicial process, or to protect the
  7 18 safety of the internet site users or persons identified on the
  7 19 internet site or security of the internet site.
  7 20    The operator may also disclose covered information to a
  7 21 service provider if the operator implements and maintains
  7 22 reasonable security procedures and practices, and, if the
  7 23 service provider is contractually prohibited from using any
  7 24 of the information for any purpose other than providing the
  7 25 contracted service to, or on behalf of, the operator, and from
  7 26 disclosing any covered information provided by the operator to
  7 27 subsequent third parties.
  7 28    However, these prohibitions shall not be construed to
  7 29 prohibit the operator's use of information for maintaining,
  7 30 developing, supporting, improving, or diagnosing the operator's
  7 31 internet site, service, or application.
  7 32    The operator is required to implement and maintain
  7 33 reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the
  7 34 nature of the covered information, and protect that information
  7 35 from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or
  8  1 disclosure; and to delete a student's covered information if
  8  2 the school district, accredited nonpublic school, or area
  8  3 education agency requests deletion of data under the control of
  8  4 the school district, school, or area education agency.
  8  5    Notwithstanding the disclosure prohibitions, as long as the
  8  6 operator does not violate the provisions prohibiting targeting
  8  7 advertising, the use of student information to amass a profile,
  8  8 and the sale of student information, an operator may disclose
  8  9 covered information of a student if other provisions of federal
  8 10 or state law require the operator to disclose the information,
  8 11 or for legitimate research purposes as required by and subject
  8 12 to state or federal law and under the direction of the school
  8 13 district, school, or area education agency; and to state or
  8 14 local educational agencies as permitted by state or federal
  8 15 law.
  8 16    The bill shall not be construed to prohibit an operator
  8 17 from using deidentified student covered information to improve
  8 18 educational products or to demonstrate the effectiveness of
  8 19 the operator's products or services and their marketing; to
  8 20 prohibit an operator from sharing aggregated deidentified
  8 21 student covered information for the development and improvement
  8 22 of educational internet sites, services, or applications; to
  8 23 limit a law enforcement agency from obtaining information
  8 24 as authorized by law or court order; to limit the ability
  8 25 of an operator to use student data for adaptive learning or
  8 26 customized student learning purposes; to apply to general
  8 27 audience internet sites, general audience online services,
  8 28 general audience online applications, or general audience
  8 29 mobile applications; to restrict internet service providers
  8 30 from providing internet connectivity to schools or students
  8 31 and their families; to prohibit an operator from marketing
  8 32 educational products directly to parents so long as the
  8 33 marketing did not result from the use of covered information;
  8 34 to impose a duty upon a provider of an electronic store,
  8 35 gateway, marketplace, or other means of purchasing or
  9  1 downloading software or applications to review or enforce
  9  2 compliance with applicable restrictions by such software
  9  3 or applications; to impose a duty upon a provider of an
  9  4 interactive computer service to review or enforce compliance
  9  5 by third=party content providers; or to impede the ability of
  9  6 students to download, export, or otherwise save or maintain
  9  7 their own student=created data or documents.
  9  8    REMEDIES.  The bill provides that a violation of new Code
  9  9 chapter 715D is a prohibited practice or act under Code section
  9 10 714H.3, providing for a private right of action for a person
  9 11 who suffers an ascertainable loss of money or property as the

  9 13 bring an action at law to recover actual damages and to seek
  9 14 court protection from further violations including temporary
  9 15 and permanent injunctive relief.
  9 16    The bill provides that a violation of new Code chapter 715D

  9 20 seek and obtain an order that a party held to violate the
