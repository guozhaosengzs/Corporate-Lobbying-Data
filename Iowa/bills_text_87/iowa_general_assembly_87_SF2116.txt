  3  1 July 1, 2018.
  3  2    2.  Notwithstanding subsection 1, the section of this Act

  3  6                           EXPLANATION
  3  7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  8 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  9    This bill relates to the production or manufacture of
  3 10 certain goods within the state of Iowa and federal regulatory
  3 11 authority.
  3 12    The bill provides legislative findings regarding the
  3 13 retention and delegation of powers in the United States
  3 14 Constitution, including that the power to regulate intrastate
  3 15 commerce is reserved to the states or the people under the
  3 16 ninth and tenth amendments to the Constitution.
  3 17    The bill defines "goods" to mean all real or personal
  3 18 property, whether tangible or intangible, regardless of when
  3 19 the property was produced or manufactured.  The bill defines
  3 20 "produced" to mean grown, mined, or extracted.
  3 21    The bill states that all goods produced or manufactured
  3 22 either commercially or privately within Iowa that are held,
  3 23 maintained, or retained within Iowa shall not be deemed to
  3 24 have traveled in interstate commerce and therefore shall
  3 25 not be subject to federal law, federal regulation, or the
  3 26 constitutional authority of the Congress of the United
  3 27 States to regulate interstate commerce.  The bill states
  3 28 that the federal authority to regulate interstate commerce
  3 29 in basic materials or parts used in processing or producing
  3 30 does not include the authority to regulate goods produced
  3 31 or manufactured within Iowa, regardless of where the basic
  3 32 materials or parts were obtained. The bill further provides
  3 33 that protection from federal regulation shall be confined to
  3 34 goods manufactured within Iowa that have "made in Iowa" clearly
  3 35 stamped or marked on an integral part or goods produced in Iowa
  4  1 if the words "product of Iowa" are clearly stamped or marked
  4  2 on the container or packaging.  The bill further provides that
  4  3 goods ordered, procured, or purchased by the United States
  4  4 government or by any contractor pursuant to an agreement with

  3 35 stamped or marked on an integral part or goods produced in Iowa
  4  1 if the words "product of Iowa" are clearly stamped or marked

  4  4 government or by any contractor pursuant to an agreement with
  4  5 the United States government are not included in the protection
  4  6 from federal regulation.
  4  7    The bill specifies that any official, agent, or employee of
  4  8 the United States government or any employee of a corporation
  4  9 providing services to the United States government who enforces
  4 10 or attempts to enforce an Act, order, law, statute, rule, or
  4 11 regulation of the government of the United States in violation
  4 12 of the bill's provisions shall be guilty of a class "D" felony.
  4 13 A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no more
  4 14 than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more than
  4 15 $7,500.  The bill further specifies that a public officer or

  4 17 Act, order, law, statute, rule, or regulation of the government
  4 18 of the United States in violation of the bill shall be guilty
  4 19 of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable
  4 20 by confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least

  3  6                           EXPLANATION
  3  7 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  8 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  9    This bill relates to the production or manufacture of
  3 10 certain goods within the state of Iowa and federal regulatory
  3 11 authority.
  3 12    The bill provides legislative findings regarding the
  3 13 retention and delegation of powers in the United States
  3 14 Constitution, including that the power to regulate intrastate
  3 15 commerce is reserved to the states or the people under the
  3 16 ninth and tenth amendments to the Constitution.
  3 17    The bill defines "goods" to mean all real or personal
  3 18 property, whether tangible or intangible, regardless of when
  3 19 the property was produced or manufactured.  The bill defines
  3 20 "produced" to mean grown, mined, or extracted.
  3 21    The bill states that all goods produced or manufactured
  3 22 either commercially or privately within Iowa that are held,
  3 23 maintained, or retained within Iowa shall not be deemed to
  3 24 have traveled in interstate commerce and therefore shall
  3 25 not be subject to federal law, federal regulation, or the
  3 26 constitutional authority of the Congress of the United
  3 27 States to regulate interstate commerce.  The bill states
  3 28 that the federal authority to regulate interstate commerce
  3 29 in basic materials or parts used in processing or producing
  3 30 does not include the authority to regulate goods produced
  3 31 or manufactured within Iowa, regardless of where the basic
  3 32 materials or parts were obtained. The bill further provides
  3 33 that protection from federal regulation shall be confined to
  3 34 goods manufactured within Iowa that have "made in Iowa" clearly
  3 35 stamped or marked on an integral part or goods produced in Iowa
  4  1 if the words "product of Iowa" are clearly stamped or marked
  4  2 on the container or packaging.  The bill further provides that
  4  3 goods ordered, procured, or purchased by the United States
  4  4 government or by any contractor pursuant to an agreement with
  4  5 the United States government are not included in the protection
  4  6 from federal regulation.
  4  7    The bill specifies that any official, agent, or employee of
  4  8 the United States government or any employee of a corporation
  4  9 providing services to the United States government who enforces
  4 10 or attempts to enforce an Act, order, law, statute, rule, or
  4 11 regulation of the government of the United States in violation
  4 12 of the bill's provisions shall be guilty of a class "D" felony.
  4 13 A class "D" felony is punishable by confinement for no more
  4 14 than five years and a fine of at least $750 but not more than
  4 15 $7,500.  The bill further specifies that a public officer or
  4 16 employee of this state who enforces or attempts to enforce an
  4 17 Act, order, law, statute, rule, or regulation of the government
  4 18 of the United States in violation of the bill shall be guilty
  4 19 of a serious misdemeanor. A serious misdemeanor is punishable
  4 20 by confinement for no more than one year and a fine of at least
  4 21 $315 but not more than $1,875.
  4 22    The bill applies to goods held, maintained, or retained
  4 23 within the boundaries of this state that have been produced or
  4 24 manufactured within this state at any time before, on, or after
  4 25 July 1, 2018. Penalty provisions apply to violations occurring
