  4 25 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 26 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 27    This bill relates to adoption.
  4 28    The bill replaces references to "husband" and "wife" with
  4 29 "spouse" in provisions relating to qualifications to file an
  4 30 adoption petition.
  4 31    Under Code chapter 600 (adoption), "adult" is defined as
  4 32 a person who is married or 18 years of age or older.  Under
  4 33 current law, however, Code section 600.16 provides that for
  4 34 the purposes of making available medical and developmental
  4 35 history information that was collected during the preplacement
  5  1 investigation for an adoption, "adult" is defined as a person
  5  2 21 years of age or older or a person who attains majority by
  5  3 marriage.  The bill eliminates this definition of "adult",
  5  4 thereby defining adult as a person who is married or 18 years
  5  5 of age or older consistently throughout the chapter.
  5  6    The bill also provides additional means of allowing a
  5  7 permanent adoption record to be open to an adopted person who
  5  8 is an adult.
  5  9    Current law provides that the court shall, for good cause,
  5 10 order the opening of the permanent adoption record for an
  5 11 adopted person who is an adult and reveal the names of either
  5 12 or both of the biological parents following consideration of
  5 13 the affidavit of a biological parent requesting that the court
  5 14 reveal or not reveal the parent's identity and consideration of
  5 15 the fact that the adopted person who files the application has
  5 16 a sibling who is a minor and who has been adopted by the same
  5 17 parents.  Under the bill, the court would no longer require
  5 18 good cause based upon these considerations, but instead, upon
  5 19 the filing of an affidavit by the adopted person who is an
  5 20 adult, the court would open the permanent adoption records
  5 21 for the adopted person.  The bill also amends the provisions
  5 22 relating to the court opening termination or adoption records
  5 23 if the opening is shown to be necessary to save the life of
  5 24 or prevent irreparable physical or mental harm to an adopted
  5 25 person or the person's offspring. Current law requires the
  5 26 court to make every reasonable effort to prevent the identity
  5 27 of the biological parents from becoming revealed to the adopted
  5 28 person when such opening of the record is allowed. The bill
  5 29 would only require the court to  make every reasonable effort to
  5 30 prevent the identity of the biological parents from becoming
  5 31 revealed to the adopted person when the adopted person is a
  5 32 minor, but not when the adopted person is an adult.
  5 33    Current law also includes a mutual consent provision under
  5 34 which a permanent adoption record may be opened and reveal
  5 35 the names of either or both of the biological parents if
  6  1 a biological parent places in the adoption record written
  6  2 consent to revelation of the biological parent's identity
  6  3 to the adopted child at an age specified by the biological
  6  4 parent upon request of the adopted child, and the adult
  6  5 adopted child in turn has placed in the adoption record
  6  6 written consent to revelation of the identity of the adult
  6  7 adopted child to a biological parent. The bill retains the
  6  8 mutual consent opportunity but provides that the requirements
  6  9 of the mutual consent process to request the opening of the
  6 10 permanent adoption records shall not preclude the opening of
  6 11 the permanent adoption record if requested by an adopted person
  6 12 who is an adult.
  6 13    Under current law, an adopted person whose adoption became
  6 14 final prior to July 4, 1941, and whose adoption record was
  6 15 not required to be sealed at the time when the adoption
  6 16 record was completed, is not required to show good cause for
  6 17 an order opening the adoption record. The bill amends this
  6 18 provision to be consistent with the provisions of the bill so
  6 19 that the requirement for showing good cause is stricken, and
  6 20 additionally the person is not required as other adults under
  6 21 the bill to file an affidavit to request an order to open the
  6 22 adoption record.

  4 31    Under Code chapter 600 (adoption), "adult" is defined as
  4 32 a person who is married or 18 years of age or older.  Under
