  3 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 30    This bill relates to state taxation by creating an excise tax
  3 31 on the sale or use of bottled water, providing for the transfer
  3 32 of the excise tax revenues, and making appropriations.
  3 33    The bill creates an excise tax at the rate of 6 percent on
  3 34 the sales price or purchase price of bottled water sold or used
  3 35 in Iowa.  "Bottled water" is defined in the bill.  The director
  4  1 of revenue is required to administer the excise tax as nearly
  4  2 as possible in conjunction with the administration of the state
  4  3 sales and use tax laws, and, to that end, the bill incorporates
  4  4 by reference numerous Code sections that relate to general tax
  4  5 administration and the sales and use tax laws.
  4  6    The bill exempts from the excise tax any transaction that
  4  7 would be exempt from the state sales tax under Code section
  4  8 423.3 (sales tax exemptions), except for the exemptions for
  4  9 food and food ingredients in Code section 423.3(57) and for
  4 10 items purchased with food stamps and other similar federal
  4 11 benefits in Code section 423.3(58).  The bill also exempts the
  4 12 use of bottled water from the tax if the excise tax has already
  4 13 been paid on the purchase of the bottled water.  Finally, the
  4 14 bill provides a credit equal to the amount of similar tax paid
  4 15 in another state by the same taxpayer relating to the bottled
  4 16 water subject to the excise tax in Iowa.  However, the credit
  4 17 cannot exceed the amount of excise tax due in Iowa on the
  4 18 bottled water.
  4 19    Bottled water excise tax revenues are deposited in the
  4 20 general fund of the state, and the bill then requires all
  4 21 excise tax revenues to be transferred to the water quality
  4 22 initiative fund created in Code section 466B.45.
  4 23    The bottled water excise tax is repealed on the enactment
  4 24 date that the state sales tax rate in effect on July 1, 2016, is
