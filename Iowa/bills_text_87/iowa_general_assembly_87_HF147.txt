  3 22 prohibition on unlicensed carrying of weapons.
  3 23    The availability of a professional or nonprofessional permit
  3 24 to carry weapons under this chapter shall not be construed
  3 25 to impose a general prohibition on the unlicensed carrying,
  3 26 whether openly or concealed, of a dangerous weapon, including
  3 27 a loaded firearm.
  3 28                           EXPLANATION
  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill relates to the carrying and possession of weapons
  3 32 and provides penalties.
  3 33    The bill amends Code section 708.8, the crime of going
  3 34 armed with a dangerous weapon with intent, a class "D" felony,
  3 35 to provide that the intent element required for a violation
  4  1 of this crime shall not be inferred from the mere carrying
  4  2 or concealment of a dangerous weapon. "Dangerous weapon"
  4  3 is defined in Code section 702.7 for purposes of use in the
  4  4 criminal code.
  4  5    The bill amends Code section 724.4 by striking the current
  4  6 penalty for carrying dangerous weapons. Instead, the bill
  4  7 creates a new crime of going armed with a knife in the
  4  8 commission of a crime, an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill
  4  9 makes a conforming change to Code section 232.52, subsection
  4 10 2, relating to the suspension or revocation of a juvenile's
  4 11 driver's license or operating privilege. The bill also makes a
  4 12 Code change to Code section 724.4B, relating to the carrying
  4 13 of weapons on school grounds, to specifically include certain
  4 14 categories of persons who are authorized to carry weapons on
  4 15 school grounds.
  4 16    The bill amends Code section 724.4C relating to the crime of
  4 17 possession or carrying of firearms while under the influence
  4 18 of alcohol or a drug.  Current law invalidates a permit to
  4 19 carry weapons if the person to whom the permit is issued is
  4 20 intoxicated, as defined in Code section 321J.2, subsection 1
  4 21 (while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or other
  4 22 drug or a combination of such substances, while having an
  4 23 alcohol concentration of .08 or more, or while any amount of a
  4 24 controlled substance is present in the person, as measured in
  4 25 the person's blood or urine).  The bill amends this provision
  4 26 to provide that a person commits a serious misdemeanor if
  4 27 the person is intoxicated and the person either carries a
  4 28 dangerous weapon on or about the person or carries a dangerous
  4 29 weapon within the person's immediate access or reach while in
  4 30 a vehicle.  This crime does not apply to situations where a
  4 31 person carries or possesses a dangerous weapon while in the
  4 32 person's own dwelling, place of business, or on the person's
  4 33 land, and the transitory possession or use of a firearm during

  5  3 duty to carry a valid permit to carry certain weapons for
  5  4 which a permit has been issued to the person and replaces that

  3 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 31    This bill relates to the carrying and possession of weapons
  3 32 and provides penalties.
  3 33    The bill amends Code section 708.8, the crime of going
  3 34 armed with a dangerous weapon with intent, a class "D" felony,
  3 35 to provide that the intent element required for a violation
  4  1 of this crime shall not be inferred from the mere carrying
  4  2 or concealment of a dangerous weapon. "Dangerous weapon"
  4  3 is defined in Code section 702.7 for purposes of use in the
  4  4 criminal code.
  4  5    The bill amends Code section 724.4 by striking the current
  4  6 penalty for carrying dangerous weapons. Instead, the bill
  4  7 creates a new crime of going armed with a knife in the
  4  8 commission of a crime, an aggravated misdemeanor.  The bill
  4  9 makes a conforming change to Code section 232.52, subsection
  4 10 2, relating to the suspension or revocation of a juvenile's
  4 11 driver's license or operating privilege. The bill also makes a
  4 12 Code change to Code section 724.4B, relating to the carrying
  4 13 of weapons on school grounds, to specifically include certain
  4 14 categories of persons who are authorized to carry weapons on
  4 15 school grounds.
  4 16    The bill amends Code section 724.4C relating to the crime of
  4 17 possession or carrying of firearms while under the influence
  4 18 of alcohol or a drug.  Current law invalidates a permit to
  4 19 carry weapons if the person to whom the permit is issued is
  4 20 intoxicated, as defined in Code section 321J.2, subsection 1
  4 21 (while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage or other
  4 22 drug or a combination of such substances, while having an
  4 23 alcohol concentration of .08 or more, or while any amount of a
  4 24 controlled substance is present in the person, as measured in
  4 25 the person's blood or urine).  The bill amends this provision
  4 26 to provide that a person commits a serious misdemeanor if
  4 27 the person is intoxicated and the person either carries a
  4 28 dangerous weapon on or about the person or carries a dangerous
  4 29 weapon within the person's immediate access or reach while in
  4 30 a vehicle.  This crime does not apply to situations where a
  4 31 person carries or possesses a dangerous weapon while in the
  4 32 person's own dwelling, place of business, or on the person's

  4 34 an act of justified self=defense or justified defense of
  4 35 another, if the possession of the firearm lasts no longer than
  5  1 immediately necessary to resolve the emergency.
  5  2    The bill strikes Code section 724.5 relating to a person's
  5  3 duty to carry a valid permit to carry certain weapons for
