  4 19 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 20 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 21    This bill relates to seizure of property by the department
  4 22 of natural resources, provides that seized property may only
  4 23 be forfeited to the state upon conviction of the violation
  4 24 which led to the seizure, and requires the department to return
  4 25 the seized property if the person is not convicted of the
  4 26 violation.
  4 27    The bill defines "convicted" as a finding of guilt, payment
  4 28 of a scheduled fine, a plea of guilty, deferred judgment,
  4 29 deferred or suspended sentence, adjudication of delinquency,
  4 30 or circumstance where a person is not charged with a criminal
  4 31 offense related to the violation based in whole or in part on
  4 32 the person's agreement to provide information regarding the
  4 33 criminal activity of another person.
  4 34    Under current law, a peace officer may seize any fish,
  4 35 furs, birds, animals, mussels, clams, or frogs which have
  5  1 been caught, taken, or killed at a time, in a manner, or for
  5  2 a purpose, or had in possession or under control, or offered
  5  3 for shipment, or illegally transported in the state or to a
  5  4 point beyond its borders, contrary to the Code. Such seized
  5  5 wildlife may be disposed of or relinquished to a representative
  5  6 of the natural resource commission. The bill provides that
  5  7 such seized wildlife must be kept for trial, and if the
  5  8 person from whom the wildlife was seized is not convicted, the
  5  9 department of natural resources, law enforcement agency, or
  5 10 other governmental agency in possession of the seized property
  5 11 shall return the wildlife within 30 days of the person being
  5 12 found not guilty, the action being dismissed, or the expiration
  5 13 of the statute of limitations for the alleged violation for
  5 14 which the property was seized.
  5 15    Under current law, any device, contrivance, or material
  5 16 used to violate a rule adopted by the commission, or any other
  5 17 provision of Code chapter 481A (wildlife conservation), 481B
  5 18 (endangered plants and wildlife), 482 (commercial fishing),
  5 19 483A (fishing and hunting licenses, contraband, and guns),
  5 20 484A (migratory game birds), or 484B (hunting preserves), is
  5 21 a public nuisance and may be condemned by the state. The bill
  5 22 provides that such seized property may only be condemned by
  5 23 the state if the person from whom the property was seized is
  5 24 convicted of the violation for which the property was seized
  5 25 as a public nuisance. If the person from whom the property was
  5 26 seized is not convicted, the department of natural resources,
  5 27 law enforcement agency, or other governmental agency in
  5 28 possession of the property is required to return the property
  5 29 to the person within 30 days of the person being found not
  5 30 guilty, the action being dismissed, or the expiration of the
  5 31 statute of limitations for the alleged violation for which the
  5 32 property was seized.
  5 33    Under current law, after the state files an application for
  5 34 condemnation of property seized as a public nuisance, a person
  5 35 must file an application for return within 30 days. Failure to
  6  1 timely file the application terminates the person's interest in
  6  2 the property. A hearing for the condemnation of the property
  6  3 then must be held not less than 10 nor more than 30 days after
  6  4 the application for return is filed.
  6  5    The bill provides that a person must file an application
  6  6 for return within 30 days of the state's application for
  6  7 condemnation or the conviction of the person, whichever
  6  8 occurs later, except that a person who is not convicted of
  6  9 the violation is not required to file an application and is
  6 10 entitled to the return of the property. The bill also provides
  6 11 that a hearing for the condemnation of the property, if any,
  6 12 must be held not less than 10 nor more than 30 days after
  6 13 the application for return is filed or the conviction of the
  6 14 person, whichever occurs later.
