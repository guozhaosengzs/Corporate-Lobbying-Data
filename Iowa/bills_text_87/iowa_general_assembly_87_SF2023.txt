  9 30 therapists. Under the bill, the board of behavioral science
  9 31 shall administer the licensure of clinical art therapists and

  9 33 therapy. The bill modifies the membership of the board of
  9 34 behavioral science to add one clinical art therapist and remove
  9 35 one public member. The bill provides that persons not licensed
 10  1 under the bill but referring to themselves as clinical art
 10  2 therapists or using other similar terms or abbreviations shall
 10  3 be guilty of a simple misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is
 10  4 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of
 10  5 at least $65 but not more than $625 or by both.
 10  6    The bill defines several terms including "art therapy"
 10  7 and "clinical art therapy". The bill provides for temporary

 10 17 licensees under Code chapter 154D to use art or art materials
 10 18 as part of their practice without an art therapy license if
 10 19 they do not represent that they practice art therapy.
 10 20    The bill includes licensed certified art therapists as
 10 21 "health care providers" eligible to provide services through
 10 22 the volunteer health care provider program created in Code
 10 23 section 135.24. The bill provides that the board of behavioral
 10 24 science may waive the licensing requirements established by
 10 25 the bill for persons with certain qualifications in the first
 10 26 year after rules implementing the licensure of clinical art
 10 27 therapists are adopted. The bill also directs the board to
 10 28 grant temporary licenses to applicants seeking to practice
 10 29 clinical art therapy under supervision whose supervision plan
 10 30 includes supervision by a registered art therapist who has been
 10 31 practicing for at least five years. This directive applies for

  9 30 therapists. Under the bill, the board of behavioral science
  9 31 shall administer the licensure of clinical art therapists and
  9 32 shall adopt rules relating to the practice of clinical art
  9 33 therapy. The bill modifies the membership of the board of
  9 34 behavioral science to add one clinical art therapist and remove
  9 35 one public member. The bill provides that persons not licensed
 10  1 under the bill but referring to themselves as clinical art
 10  2 therapists or using other similar terms or abbreviations shall
 10  3 be guilty of a simple misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is
 10  4 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of
 10  5 at least $65 but not more than $625 or by both.
 10  6    The bill defines several terms including "art therapy"
 10  7 and "clinical art therapy". The bill provides for temporary

 10 14 another program approved by the board of behavioral science,
 10 15 pass a national board examination, and complete at least
 10 16 two years of supervised experience. The bill allows other
 10 17 licensees under Code chapter 154D to use art or art materials
 10 18 as part of their practice without an art therapy license if
 10 19 they do not represent that they practice art therapy.
 10 20    The bill includes licensed certified art therapists as
 10 21 "health care providers" eligible to provide services through
 10 22 the volunteer health care provider program created in Code
 10 23 section 135.24. The bill provides that the board of behavioral
 10 24 science may waive the licensing requirements established by
 10 25 the bill for persons with certain qualifications in the first
 10 26 year after rules implementing the licensure of clinical art
 10 27 therapists are adopted. The bill also directs the board to
 10 28 grant temporary licenses to applicants seeking to practice
 10 29 clinical art therapy under supervision whose supervision plan
 10 30 includes supervision by a registered art therapist who has been
 10 31 practicing for at least five years. This directive applies for
 10 32 the first three years following the effective date of rules
 10 33 implementing the bill. The bill includes an effective date of
 10 34 January 1, 2019, except that the board of behavioral science

 11  1 necessary to fully implement the provisions providing for the

 10 14 another program approved by the board of behavioral science,
 10 15 pass a national board examination, and complete at least
 10 16 two years of supervised experience. The bill allows other
 10 17 licensees under Code chapter 154D to use art or art materials
 10 18 as part of their practice without an art therapy license if
 10 19 they do not represent that they practice art therapy.
 10 20    The bill includes licensed certified art therapists as
 10 21 "health care providers" eligible to provide services through
 10 22 the volunteer health care provider program created in Code
 10 23 section 135.24. The bill provides that the board of behavioral
 10 24 science may waive the licensing requirements established by
 10 25 the bill for persons with certain qualifications in the first
 10 26 year after rules implementing the licensure of clinical art
 10 27 therapists are adopted. The bill also directs the board to

 10 29 clinical art therapy under supervision whose supervision plan
 10 30 includes supervision by a registered art therapist who has been
 10 31 practicing for at least five years. This directive applies for

  9 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 29    This bill provides for the licensure of clinical art
  9 30 therapists. Under the bill, the board of behavioral science
  9 31 shall administer the licensure of clinical art therapists and
  9 32 shall adopt rules relating to the practice of clinical art
  9 33 therapy. The bill modifies the membership of the board of
  9 34 behavioral science to add one clinical art therapist and remove
  9 35 one public member. The bill provides that persons not licensed
 10  1 under the bill but referring to themselves as clinical art
 10  2 therapists or using other similar terms or abbreviations shall
 10  3 be guilty of a simple misdemeanor. A simple misdemeanor is
 10  4 punishable by confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of
 10  5 at least $65 but not more than $625 or by both.
 10  6    The bill defines several terms including "art therapy"
 10  7 and "clinical art therapy". The bill provides for temporary

 10 14 another program approved by the board of behavioral science,
 10 15 pass a national board examination, and complete at least
 10 16 two years of supervised experience. The bill allows other
 10 17 licensees under Code chapter 154D to use art or art materials
 10 18 as part of their practice without an art therapy license if
 10 19 they do not represent that they practice art therapy.
 10 20    The bill includes licensed certified art therapists as
 10 21 "health care providers" eligible to provide services through
 10 22 the volunteer health care provider program created in Code
 10 23 section 135.24. The bill provides that the board of behavioral
 10 24 science may waive the licensing requirements established by
 10 25 the bill for persons with certain qualifications in the first
 10 26 year after rules implementing the licensure of clinical art
 10 27 therapists are adopted. The bill also directs the board to
 10 28 grant temporary licenses to applicants seeking to practice
 10 29 clinical art therapy under supervision whose supervision plan
 10 30 includes supervision by a registered art therapist who has been
 10 31 practicing for at least five years. This directive applies for
 10 32 the first three years following the effective date of rules
 10 33 implementing the bill. The bill includes an effective date of
 10 34 January 1, 2019, except that the board of behavioral science
 10 35 may begin implementation prior to that date, to the extent
 11  1 necessary to fully implement the provisions providing for the
