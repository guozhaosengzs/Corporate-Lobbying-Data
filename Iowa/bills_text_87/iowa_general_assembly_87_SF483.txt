  5 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with

  6  1 This bill requires a primary runoff election be held to
  6  2 determine a party's nominee in the case of an inconclusive
  6  3 primary election for certain offices. Under current law, an
  6  4 inconclusive primary occurs when there is not a sufficient
  6  5 number of candidates who received at least 35 percent of the
  6  6 vote in the primary election to fill the necessary number
  6  7 of nominations for an office. Current law provides that
  6  8 nominations following an inconclusive primary be filled by the
  6  9 party's state convention, congressional district convention,
  6 10 party precinct committee members, county convention delegates,
  6 11 or county convention precinct delegates, as applicable.
  6 12    Primary runoff elections are to be held on the first Tuesday
  6 13 after the first Monday in August after the primary election
  6 14 and are to be conducted and the results canvassed in the same
  6 15 manner as primary elections.
  6 16    Relating to primary runoff elections for county offices,
  6 17 the bill provides that when one nominee is required, the two
  6 18 candidates who received the highest number of votes cast for
  6 19 the nomination shall be the candidates in the primary runoff
  6 20 election.  When two or more nominees are required and the
  6 21 necessary number of nominations were not made at the primary
  6 22 election, the number of candidates in the primary runoff
  6 23 election shall equal one more than the remaining necessary
  6 24 number of nominations, and the candidates shall be the
  6 25 remaining candidates who received the highest number of votes
  6 26 cast in the primary election but who did not receive at least
  6 27 35 percent of the vote cast to be nominated in the primary
  6 28 election.  The candidate or candidates who receive the highest
  6 29 number of votes cast by voters of the nominating party in the
  6 30 primary runoff election shall be the nominee or nominees of
  6 31 that party for that office in the general election.
  6 32    Relating to primary runoff elections for statewide office,
  6 33 congressional office, and members of the general assembly,
  6 34 the bill provides that the two candidates who received the
  6 35 highest number of votes cast in the primary election shall be
  7  1 the candidates in the primary runoff election.  The candidate
  7  2 in the primary runoff election who receives the highest number
  7  3 of votes cast by voters of the nominating party shall be the
  7  4 nominee of that party for that office in the general election.
  7  5    The bill requires that if a person receives enough write=in
  7  6 votes at an inconclusive primary election to be placed on
  7  7 a primary runoff election ballot, the county commissioner
  7  8 of elections or the state commissioner of elections, as
  7  9 appropriate, shall immediately after the canvass of the primary
  7 10 election notify the person that the person is required to
  7 11 file an affidavit of candidacy if the person wishes to be a
  7 12 candidate for nomination to that office at the primary runoff
  7 13 election.
  7 14    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
  7 15 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
  7 16 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
  7 17 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
  7 18 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
  7 19 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
  7 20 mandate included in the bill.
