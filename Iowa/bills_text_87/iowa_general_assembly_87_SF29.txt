 39  7    1.  Pupils eligible to enroll in grades kindergarten through
 39  8 twelve or eligible to participate in a preschool program under
 39  9 chapter 256C and attending a nonpublic school, receiving
 39 10 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, or receiving
 39 11 private preschool instruction shall be eligible to receive an
 39 12 education savings grant in the manner provided in this section
 39 13 for school years beginning on or after July 1, 2018.  Education
 39 14 savings grants shall be made available to parents and guardians
 39 15 in the manner authorized under subsection 4, paragraph "c", for
 39 16 the payment of qualified educational expenses as provided in
 39 17 this section.
 39 18    2.  a.  (1)  By January 31 preceding the school year for
 39 19 which the education savings grant is requested, the parent
 39 20 or guardian of the pupil requesting to receive an education
 39 21 savings grant shall submit an application to the department of
 39 22 management, on application forms developed by the department of
 39 23 management, indicating that the parent or guardian intends to
 39 24 enroll the pupil in a nonpublic school, place the pupil under
 39 25 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, or provide
 39 26 private preschool instruction.
 39 27    (2)  In addition to such information deemed appropriate by
 39 28 the department of management, the application shall require
 39 29 certification from the nonpublic school of the pupil's
 39 30 enrollment for the following school year or a statement
 39 31 indicating the parent or guardian's intent to place the pupil
 39 32 under competent private instruction or private preschool
 39 33 instruction for the following school year.
 39 34    b.  By March 1 preceding the school year for which the
 39 35 education savings grant is requested, the department of
 40  1 management shall notify the parent or guardian of each pupil
 40  2 who is approved to receive an education savings grant and the
 40  3 amount of the grant.
 40  4    c.  Education savings grants shall only be approved for one
 40  5 school year and applications must be submitted annually for
 40  6 education savings grants in subsequent school years.
 40  7    3.  a.  The department of management shall assign each
 40  8 pupil an education savings grant in an amount equal to the
 40  9 difference between eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of
 40 10 the regular program state cost per pupil and the statewide
 40 11 average foundation property tax per pupil for the same school
 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate
 40 13 in a preschool program under chapter 256C, the amount of the
 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.
 40 16    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following
 40 17 the determination of the amount of the education savings grant
 40 18 for each approved pupil transfer such amounts to the pupil's
 40 19 account in the education savings grant fund established under
 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection
 40 22 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that
 40 24 school year.
 40 25    4.  An education savings grant fund is created in the state
 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July
 40 30 1, 2018, and each succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated
 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all
 40 35 powers necessary to carry out and effectuate the purposes,
 41  1 objectives, and provisions of this section pertaining to the
 41  2 fund, including the power to do all of the following:
 41  3    a.  Make and enter into contracts necessary for the
 41  4 administration of the fund.
 41  5    b.  Procure insurance against any loss in connection with the
 41  6 assets of the fund or require a surety bond.
 41  7    c.  Contract with a private financial management firm to
 41  8 manage the fund, in collaboration with the treasurer of state,
 41  9 including providing for the disbursement of education savings
 41 10 grants in the form of an electronic debit card or checks that
 41 11 are payable directly from the pupil's account within the fund.
 41 12    d.  Conduct audits or other review necessary to properly
 41 13 administer the program.
 41 14    e.  Adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A for the
 41 15 administration of the fund and accounts within the fund.
 41 16    5.  a.  For each pupil approved for an education savings
 41 17 grant, the department of management shall establish an account
 41 18 for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.  The
 41 19 amount of the pupil's education savings grant determined under
 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
 41 33 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified
 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for
 42  4 tutoring or cognitive skills training, curriculum materials,
 42  5 tuition or fees for nonpublic online education programs,
 42  6 education materials and services for pupils with disabilities,
 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the
 44  5 following new subsection:
 44  6     39  7    1.  Pupils eligible to enroll in grades kindergarten through
 39  8 twelve or eligible to participate in a preschool program under
 39  9 chapter 256C and attending a nonpublic school, receiving
 39 10 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, or receiving
 39 11 private preschool instruction shall be eligible to receive an
 39 12 education savings grant in the manner provided in this section
 39 13 for school years beginning on or after July 1, 2018.  Education
 39 14 savings grants shall be made available to parents and guardians
 39 15 in the manner authorized under subsection 4, paragraph "c", for
 39 16 the payment of qualified educational expenses as provided in
 39 17 this section.
 39 18    2.  a.  (1)  By January 31 preceding the school year for
 39 19 which the education savings grant is requested, the parent
 39 20 or guardian of the pupil requesting to receive an education
 39 21 savings grant shall submit an application to the department of
 39 22 management, on application forms developed by the department of
 39 23 management, indicating that the parent or guardian intends to
 39 24 enroll the pupil in a nonpublic school, place the pupil under
 39 25 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, or provide
 39 26 private preschool instruction.
 39 27    (2)  In addition to such information deemed appropriate by
 39 28 the department of management, the application shall require
 39 29 certification from the nonpublic school of the pupil's
 39 30 enrollment for the following school year or a statement
 39 31 indicating the parent or guardian's intent to place the pupil
 39 32 under competent private instruction or private preschool
 39 33 instruction for the following school year.
 39 34    b.  By March 1 preceding the school year for which the
 39 35 education savings grant is requested, the department of
 40  1 management shall notify the parent or guardian of each pupil
 40  2 who is approved to receive an education savings grant and the
 40  3 amount of the grant.
 40  4    c.  Education savings grants shall only be approved for one
 40  5 school year and applications must be submitted annually for
 40  6 education savings grants in subsequent school years.
 40  7    3.  a.  The department of management shall assign each
 40  8 pupil an education savings grant in an amount equal to the
 40  9 difference between eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of
 40 10 the regular program state cost per pupil and the statewide
 40 11 average foundation property tax per pupil for the same school
 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate
 40 13 in a preschool program under chapter 256C, the amount of the
 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.
 40 16    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following
 40 17 the determination of the amount of the education savings grant
 40 18 for each approved pupil transfer such amounts to the pupil's
 40 19 account in the education savings grant fund established under
 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection
 40 22 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that
 40 24 school year.
 40 25    4.  An education savings grant fund is created in the state
 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July
 40 30 1, 2018, and each succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated
 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all
 40 35 powers necessary to carry out and effectuate the purposes,
 41  1 objectives, and provisions of this section pertaining to the
 41  2 fund, including the power to do all of the following:
 41  3    a.  Make and enter into contracts necessary for the
 41  4 administration of the fund.
 41  5    b.  Procure insurance against any loss in connection with the
 41  6 assets of the fund or require a surety bond.
 41  7    c.  Contract with a private financial management firm to
 41  8 manage the fund, in collaboration with the treasurer of state,
 41  9 including providing for the disbursement of education savings
 41 10 grants in the form of an electronic debit card or checks that
 41 11 are payable directly from the pupil's account within the fund.
 41 12    d.  Conduct audits or other review necessary to properly
 41 13 administer the program.

 41 16    5.  a.  For each pupil approved for an education savings

 41 18 for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.  The
 41 19 amount of the pupil's education savings grant determined under
 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
 41 33 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified
 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for
 42  4 tutoring or cognitive skills training, curriculum materials,
 42  5 tuition or fees for nonpublic online education programs,
 42  6 education materials and services for pupils with disabilities,
 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the
 44  5 following new subsection:
 44  6     39  8 twelve or eligible to participate in a preschool program under
 39  9 chapter 256C and attending a nonpublic school, receiving
 39 10 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, or receiving
 39 11 private preschool instruction shall be eligible to receive an
 39 12 education savings grant in the manner provided in this section
 39 13 for school years beginning on or after July 1, 2018.  Education
 39 14 savings grants shall be made available to parents and guardians
 39 15 in the manner authorized under subsection 4, paragraph "c", for
 39 16 the payment of qualified educational expenses as provided in
 39 17 this section.
 39 18    2.  a.  (1)  By January 31 preceding the school year for
 39 19 which the education savings grant is requested, the parent
 39 20 or guardian of the pupil requesting to receive an education
 39 21 savings grant shall submit an application to the department of
 39 22 management, on application forms developed by the department of
 39 23 management, indicating that the parent or guardian intends to
 39 24 enroll the pupil in a nonpublic school, place the pupil under
 39 25 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, or provide
 39 26 private preschool instruction.
 39 27    (2)  In addition to such information deemed appropriate by
 39 28 the department of management, the application shall require
 39 29 certification from the nonpublic school of the pupil's
 39 30 enrollment for the following school year or a statement
 39 31 indicating the parent or guardian's intent to place the pupil
 39 32 under competent private instruction or private preschool
 39 33 instruction for the following school year.
 39 34    b.  By March 1 preceding the school year for which the
 39 35 education savings grant is requested, the department of
 40  1 management shall notify the parent or guardian of each pupil
 40  2 who is approved to receive an education savings grant and the
 40  3 amount of the grant.
 40  4    c.  Education savings grants shall only be approved for one
 40  5 school year and applications must be submitted annually for
 40  6 education savings grants in subsequent school years.
 40  7    3.  a.  The department of management shall assign each
 40  8 pupil an education savings grant in an amount equal to the
 40  9 difference between eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of
 40 10 the regular program state cost per pupil and the statewide
 40 11 average foundation property tax per pupil for the same school
 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate
 40 13 in a preschool program under chapter 256C, the amount of the
 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.
 40 16    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following
 40 17 the determination of the amount of the education savings grant
 40 18 for each approved pupil transfer such amounts to the pupil's
 40 19 account in the education savings grant fund established under
 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection
 40 22 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that
 40 24 school year.
 40 25    4.  An education savings grant fund is created in the state
 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July
 40 30 1, 2018, and each succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated
 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all
 40 35 powers necessary to carry out and effectuate the purposes,
 41  1 objectives, and provisions of this section pertaining to the
 41  2 fund, including the power to do all of the following:
 41  3    a.  Make and enter into contracts necessary for the
 41  4 administration of the fund.
 41  5    b.  Procure insurance against any loss in connection with the
 41  6 assets of the fund or require a surety bond.
 41  7    c.  Contract with a private financial management firm to
 41  8 manage the fund, in collaboration with the treasurer of state,
 41  9 including providing for the disbursement of education savings
 41 10 grants in the form of an electronic debit card or checks that
 41 11 are payable directly from the pupil's account within the fund.
 41 12    d.  Conduct audits or other review necessary to properly
 41 13 administer the program.
 41 14    e.  Adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A for the

 41 16    5.  a.  For each pupil approved for an education savings
 41 17 grant, the department of management shall establish an account
 41 18 for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.  The
 41 19 amount of the pupil's education savings grant determined under
 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
 41 33 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified
 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for

 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or

 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the
 44  5 following new subsection:

 39 12 education savings grant in the manner provided in this section
 39 13 for school years beginning on or after July 1, 2018.  Education

 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.
 40 16    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following
 40 17 the determination of the amount of the education savings grant

 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing

 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's

 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the

 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,

 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns

 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts

 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the
 44  5 following new subsection:
 44  6     39 10 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, or receiving
 39 11 private preschool instruction shall be eligible to receive an
 39 12 education savings grant in the manner provided in this section
 39 13 for school years beginning on or after July 1, 2018.  Education
 39 14 savings grants shall be made available to parents and guardians
 39 15 in the manner authorized under subsection 4, paragraph "c", for
 39 16 the payment of qualified educational expenses as provided in
 39 17 this section.
 39 18    2.  a.  (1)  By January 31 preceding the school year for
 39 19 which the education savings grant is requested, the parent
 39 20 or guardian of the pupil requesting to receive an education
 39 21 savings grant shall submit an application to the department of
 39 22 management, on application forms developed by the department of
 39 23 management, indicating that the parent or guardian intends to
 39 24 enroll the pupil in a nonpublic school, place the pupil under
 39 25 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, or provide
 39 26 private preschool instruction.
 39 27    (2)  In addition to such information deemed appropriate by
 39 28 the department of management, the application shall require
 39 29 certification from the nonpublic school of the pupil's
 39 30 enrollment for the following school year or a statement
 39 31 indicating the parent or guardian's intent to place the pupil
 39 32 under competent private instruction or private preschool
 39 33 instruction for the following school year.
 39 34    b.  By March 1 preceding the school year for which the
 39 35 education savings grant is requested, the department of
 40  1 management shall notify the parent or guardian of each pupil
 40  2 who is approved to receive an education savings grant and the
 40  3 amount of the grant.
 40  4    c.  Education savings grants shall only be approved for one
 40  5 school year and applications must be submitted annually for

 40  8 pupil an education savings grant in an amount equal to the
 40  9 difference between eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of
 40 10 the regular program state cost per pupil and the statewide
 40 11 average foundation property tax per pupil for the same school
 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate
 40 13 in a preschool program under chapter 256C, the amount of the
 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.
 40 16    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following
 40 17 the determination of the amount of the education savings grant
 40 18 for each approved pupil transfer such amounts to the pupil's
 40 19 account in the education savings grant fund established under
 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection
 40 22 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that
 40 24 school year.
 40 25    4.  An education savings grant fund is created in the state
 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July
 40 30 1, 2018, and each succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated
 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all
 40 35 powers necessary to carry out and effectuate the purposes,
 41  1 objectives, and provisions of this section pertaining to the
 41  2 fund, including the power to do all of the following:
 41  3    a.  Make and enter into contracts necessary for the
 41  4 administration of the fund.
 41  5    b.  Procure insurance against any loss in connection with the
 41  6 assets of the fund or require a surety bond.
 41  7    c.  Contract with a private financial management firm to
 41  8 manage the fund, in collaboration with the treasurer of state,
 41  9 including providing for the disbursement of education savings
 41 10 grants in the form of an electronic debit card or checks that
 41 11 are payable directly from the pupil's account within the fund.
 41 12    d.  Conduct audits or other review necessary to properly
 41 13 administer the program.
 41 14    e.  Adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A for the
 41 15 administration of the fund and accounts within the fund.
 41 16    5.  a.  For each pupil approved for an education savings

 41 18 for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.  The
 41 19 amount of the pupil's education savings grant determined under
 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
 41 33 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified
 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for
 42  4 tutoring or cognitive skills training, curriculum materials,
 42  5 tuition or fees for nonpublic online education programs,
 42  6 education materials and services for pupils with disabilities,
 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the

 39 26 private preschool instruction.
 39 27    (2)  In addition to such information deemed appropriate by
 39 28 the department of management, the application shall require

 39 32 under competent private instruction or private preschool
 39 33 instruction for the following school year.

 40  9 difference between eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of
 40 10 the regular program state cost per pupil and the statewide
 40 11 average foundation property tax per pupil for the same school
 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate
 40 13 in a preschool program under chapter 256C, the amount of the
 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.

 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection
 40 22 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that
 40 24 school year.

 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal

 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
 41 33 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified
 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational

 41 16    5.  a.  For each pupil approved for an education savings
 41 17 grant, the department of management shall establish an account
 41 18 for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.  The
 41 19 amount of the pupil's education savings grant determined under
 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the

 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for
 42  4 tutoring or cognitive skills training, curriculum materials,
 42  5 tuition or fees for nonpublic online education programs,
 42  6 education materials and services for pupils with disabilities,
 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the
 44  5 following new subsection:
 44  6     39 13 for school years beginning on or after July 1, 2018.  Education
 39 14 savings grants shall be made available to parents and guardians
 39 15 in the manner authorized under subsection 4, paragraph "c", for
 39 16 the payment of qualified educational expenses as provided in
 39 17 this section.
 39 18    2.  a.  (1)  By January 31 preceding the school year for
 39 19 which the education savings grant is requested, the parent
 39 20 or guardian of the pupil requesting to receive an education
 39 21 savings grant shall submit an application to the department of
 39 22 management, on application forms developed by the department of
 39 23 management, indicating that the parent or guardian intends to
 39 24 enroll the pupil in a nonpublic school, place the pupil under
 39 25 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, or provide
 39 26 private preschool instruction.
 39 27    (2)  In addition to such information deemed appropriate by
 39 28 the department of management, the application shall require
 39 29 certification from the nonpublic school of the pupil's
 39 30 enrollment for the following school year or a statement
 39 31 indicating the parent or guardian's intent to place the pupil
 39 32 under competent private instruction or private preschool
 39 33 instruction for the following school year.
 39 34    b.  By March 1 preceding the school year for which the
 39 35 education savings grant is requested, the department of

 40  2 who is approved to receive an education savings grant and the
 40  3 amount of the grant.

 40  8 pupil an education savings grant in an amount equal to the
 40  9 difference between eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of
 40 10 the regular program state cost per pupil and the statewide
 40 11 average foundation property tax per pupil for the same school
 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate
 40 13 in a preschool program under chapter 256C, the amount of the
 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.
 40 16    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following
 40 17 the determination of the amount of the education savings grant
 40 18 for each approved pupil transfer such amounts to the pupil's
 40 19 account in the education savings grant fund established under
 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection
 40 22 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that
 40 24 school year.
 40 25    4.  An education savings grant fund is created in the state
 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July
 40 30 1, 2018, and each succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated
 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all

 41  3    a.  Make and enter into contracts necessary for the
 41  4 administration of the fund.
 41  5    b.  Procure insurance against any loss in connection with the
 41  6 assets of the fund or require a surety bond.
 41  7    c.  Contract with a private financial management firm to
 41  8 manage the fund, in collaboration with the treasurer of state,
 41  9 including providing for the disbursement of education savings
 41 10 grants in the form of an electronic debit card or checks that
 41 11 are payable directly from the pupil's account within the fund.
 41 12    d.  Conduct audits or other review necessary to properly
 41 13 administer the program.
 41 14    e.  Adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A for the

 41 16    5.  a.  For each pupil approved for an education savings

 41 18 for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.  The
 41 19 amount of the pupil's education savings grant determined under
 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
 41 33 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified
 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for

 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the

 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or

 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds

 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including

 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an

 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the

 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A

 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the
 44  5 following new subsection:
 44  6     39 15 in the manner authorized under subsection 4, paragraph "c", for
 39 16 the payment of qualified educational expenses as provided in
 39 17 this section.
 39 18    2.  a.  (1)  By January 31 preceding the school year for
 39 19 which the education savings grant is requested, the parent
 39 20 or guardian of the pupil requesting to receive an education
 39 21 savings grant shall submit an application to the department of
 39 22 management, on application forms developed by the department of
 39 23 management, indicating that the parent or guardian intends to
 39 24 enroll the pupil in a nonpublic school, place the pupil under
 39 25 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, or provide
 39 26 private preschool instruction.
 39 27    (2)  In addition to such information deemed appropriate by
 39 28 the department of management, the application shall require

 39 30 enrollment for the following school year or a statement

 39 32 under competent private instruction or private preschool
 39 33 instruction for the following school year.
 39 34    b.  By March 1 preceding the school year for which the
 39 35 education savings grant is requested, the department of
 40  1 management shall notify the parent or guardian of each pupil
 40  2 who is approved to receive an education savings grant and the
 40  3 amount of the grant.
 40  4    c.  Education savings grants shall only be approved for one
 40  5 school year and applications must be submitted annually for
 40  6 education savings grants in subsequent school years.

 40  8 pupil an education savings grant in an amount equal to the
 40  9 difference between eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of
 40 10 the regular program state cost per pupil and the statewide
 40 11 average foundation property tax per pupil for the same school
 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate
 40 13 in a preschool program under chapter 256C, the amount of the
 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.
 40 16    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following
 40 17 the determination of the amount of the education savings grant
 40 18 for each approved pupil transfer such amounts to the pupil's
 40 19 account in the education savings grant fund established under
 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection
 40 22 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that
 40 24 school year.
 40 25    4.  An education savings grant fund is created in the state
 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July
 40 30 1, 2018, and each succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated
 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all
 40 35 powers necessary to carry out and effectuate the purposes,
 41  1 objectives, and provisions of this section pertaining to the
 41  2 fund, including the power to do all of the following:
 41  3    a.  Make and enter into contracts necessary for the
 41  4 administration of the fund.
 41  5    b.  Procure insurance against any loss in connection with the
 41  6 assets of the fund or require a surety bond.
 41  7    c.  Contract with a private financial management firm to

 41  9 including providing for the disbursement of education savings
 41 10 grants in the form of an electronic debit card or checks that
 41 11 are payable directly from the pupil's account within the fund.
 41 12    d.  Conduct audits or other review necessary to properly
 41 13 administer the program.
 41 14    e.  Adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A for the

 41 16    5.  a.  For each pupil approved for an education savings
 41 17 grant, the department of management shall establish an account
 41 18 for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.  The
 41 19 amount of the pupil's education savings grant determined under
 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
 41 33 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified
 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for
 42  4 tutoring or cognitive skills training, curriculum materials,
 42  5 tuition or fees for nonpublic online education programs,
 42  6 education materials and services for pupils with disabilities,
 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the

 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the

 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for

 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the

 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the
 44  5 following new subsection:
 44  6     39 18    2.  a.  (1)  By January 31 preceding the school year for
 39 19 which the education savings grant is requested, the parent
 39 20 or guardian of the pupil requesting to receive an education
 39 21 savings grant shall submit an application to the department of
 39 22 management, on application forms developed by the department of
 39 23 management, indicating that the parent or guardian intends to
 39 24 enroll the pupil in a nonpublic school, place the pupil under
 39 25 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, or provide
 39 26 private preschool instruction.
 39 27    (2)  In addition to such information deemed appropriate by
 39 28 the department of management, the application shall require
 39 29 certification from the nonpublic school of the pupil's
 39 30 enrollment for the following school year or a statement
 39 31 indicating the parent or guardian's intent to place the pupil
 39 32 under competent private instruction or private preschool
 39 33 instruction for the following school year.
 39 34    b.  By March 1 preceding the school year for which the
 39 35 education savings grant is requested, the department of

 40  2 who is approved to receive an education savings grant and the
 40  3 amount of the grant.

 40  8 pupil an education savings grant in an amount equal to the
 40  9 difference between eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of
 40 10 the regular program state cost per pupil and the statewide
 40 11 average foundation property tax per pupil for the same school
 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate
 40 13 in a preschool program under chapter 256C, the amount of the
 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.
 40 16    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following
 40 17 the determination of the amount of the education savings grant
 40 18 for each approved pupil transfer such amounts to the pupil's
 40 19 account in the education savings grant fund established under
 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection
 40 22 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that
 40 24 school year.
 40 25    4.  An education savings grant fund is created in the state
 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July
 40 30 1, 2018, and each succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated
 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all

 41 11 are payable directly from the pupil's account within the fund.
 41 12    d.  Conduct audits or other review necessary to properly
 41 13 administer the program.
 41 14    e.  Adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A for the
 41 15 administration of the fund and accounts within the fund.
 41 16    5.  a.  For each pupil approved for an education savings
 41 17 grant, the department of management shall establish an account
 41 18 for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.  The
 41 19 amount of the pupil's education savings grant determined under
 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.

 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
 41 33 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified
 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for
 42  4 tutoring or cognitive skills training, curriculum materials,
 42  5 tuition or fees for nonpublic online education programs,
 42  6 education materials and services for pupils with disabilities,
 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including

 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of

 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.

 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate

 40 25    4.  An education savings grant fund is created in the state
 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July
 40 30 1, 2018, and each succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated
 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all

 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the

 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.

 39 26 private preschool instruction.
 39 27    (2)  In addition to such information deemed appropriate by
 39 28 the department of management, the application shall require
 39 29 certification from the nonpublic school of the pupil's
 39 30 enrollment for the following school year or a statement
 39 31 indicating the parent or guardian's intent to place the pupil

 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice

 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,

 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise

 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of

 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph

 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device

 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including

 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a

 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to

 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's

 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.

 39 32 under competent private instruction or private preschool
 39 33 instruction for the following school year.
 39 34    b.  By March 1 preceding the school year for which the
 39 35 education savings grant is requested, the department of

 40  2 who is approved to receive an education savings grant and the
 40  3 amount of the grant.

 40  8 pupil an education savings grant in an amount equal to the
 40  9 difference between eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of
 40 10 the regular program state cost per pupil and the statewide
 40 11 average foundation property tax per pupil for the same school
 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate
 40 13 in a preschool program under chapter 256C, the amount of the
 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.

 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection

 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that
 40 24 school year.
 40 25    4.  An education savings grant fund is created in the state
 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July
 40 30 1, 2018, and each succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated
 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all

 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings

 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary

 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private

 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the

 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent

 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including

 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.

 40  1 management shall notify the parent or guardian of each pupil
 40  2 who is approved to receive an education savings grant and the
 40  3 amount of the grant.

 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent

 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent

 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this

 39 33 instruction for the following school year.
 39 34    b.  By March 1 preceding the school year for which the
 39 35 education savings grant is requested, the department of
 40  1 management shall notify the parent or guardian of each pupil
 40  2 who is approved to receive an education savings grant and the
 40  3 amount of the grant.
 40  4    c.  Education savings grants shall only be approved for one
 40  5 school year and applications must be submitted annually for
 40  6 education savings grants in subsequent school years.
 40  7    3.  a.  The department of management shall assign each
 40  8 pupil an education savings grant in an amount equal to the
 40  9 difference between eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of
 40 10 the regular program state cost per pupil and the statewide
 40 11 average foundation property tax per pupil for the same school
 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate
 40 13 in a preschool program under chapter 256C, the amount of the
 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.
 40 16    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following
 40 17 the determination of the amount of the education savings grant
 40 18 for each approved pupil transfer such amounts to the pupil's
 40 19 account in the education savings grant fund established under
 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection
 40 22 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that

 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July
 40 30 1, 2018, and each succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated
 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all

 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
 41 33 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified
 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for

 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including

 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for

 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or

 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the

 40  1 management shall notify the parent or guardian of each pupil
 40  2 who is approved to receive an education savings grant and the
 40  3 amount of the grant.
 40  4    c.  Education savings grants shall only be approved for one
 40  5 school year and applications must be submitted annually for
 40  6 education savings grants in subsequent school years.
 40  7    3.  a.  The department of management shall assign each
 40  8 pupil an education savings grant in an amount equal to the
 40  9 difference between eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of
 40 10 the regular program state cost per pupil and the statewide
 40 11 average foundation property tax per pupil for the same school
 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate
 40 13 in a preschool program under chapter 256C, the amount of the
 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.
 40 16    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following

 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection

 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all
 40 35 powers necessary to carry out and effectuate the purposes,

 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
 41 33 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified
 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for

 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including

 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,

 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.

 40  8 pupil an education savings grant in an amount equal to the
 40  9 difference between eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of
 40 10 the regular program state cost per pupil and the statewide
 40 11 average foundation property tax per pupil for the same school
 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate
 40 13 in a preschool program under chapter 256C, the amount of the
 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.
 40 16    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following
 40 17 the determination of the amount of the education savings grant
 40 18 for each approved pupil transfer such amounts to the pupil's
 40 19 account in the education savings grant fund established under
 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection
 40 22 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that
 40 24 school year.
 40 25    4.  An education savings grant fund is created in the state
 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management

 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph

 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings

 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.

 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
 41 33 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified

 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for
 42  4 tutoring or cognitive skills training, curriculum materials,
 42  5 tuition or fees for nonpublic online education programs,
 42  6 education materials and services for pupils with disabilities,
 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the
 44  5 following new subsection:

 40  8 pupil an education savings grant in an amount equal to the
 40  9 difference between eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of
 40 10 the regular program state cost per pupil and the statewide
 40 11 average foundation property tax per pupil for the same school
 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate
 40 13 in a preschool program under chapter 256C, the amount of the
 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.
 40 16    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following
 40 17 the determination of the amount of the education savings grant
 40 18 for each approved pupil transfer such amounts to the pupil's
 40 19 account in the education savings grant fund established under
 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection
 40 22 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that
 40 24 school year.
 40 25    4.  An education savings grant fund is created in the state
 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July
 40 30 1, 2018, and each succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated
 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal

 41  3    a.  Make and enter into contracts necessary for the
 41  4 administration of the fund.

 41  6 assets of the fund or require a surety bond.

 41 11 are payable directly from the pupil's account within the fund.
 41 12    d.  Conduct audits or other review necessary to properly
 41 13 administer the program.

 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the

 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.

 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device

 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including

 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a

 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for

 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department

 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school

 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including

 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under

 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the

 40  9 difference between eighty=seven and five=tenths percent of
 40 10 the regular program state cost per pupil and the statewide
 40 11 average foundation property tax per pupil for the same school
 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate
 40 13 in a preschool program under chapter 256C, the amount of the
 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.
 40 16    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following
 40 17 the determination of the amount of the education savings grant
 40 18 for each approved pupil transfer such amounts to the pupil's
 40 19 account in the education savings grant fund established under
 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection
 40 22 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that
 40 24 school year.
 40 25    4.  An education savings grant fund is created in the state
 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July
 40 30 1, 2018, and each succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated
 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary

 41  7    c.  Contract with a private financial management firm to
 41  8 manage the fund, in collaboration with the treasurer of state,
 41  9 including providing for the disbursement of education savings
 41 10 grants in the form of an electronic debit card or checks that
 41 11 are payable directly from the pupil's account within the fund.

 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.

 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the

 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the

 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art

 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.

 40 12 year. However, for a pupil that is eligible to participate
 40 13 in a preschool program under chapter 256C, the amount of the
 40 14 grant shall be an amount equal to fifty percent of the regular
 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.
 40 16    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following

 40 18 for each approved pupil transfer such amounts to the pupil's
 40 19 account in the education savings grant fund established under
 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection
 40 22 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that
 40 24 school year.
 40 25    4.  An education savings grant fund is created in the state
 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July

 41 11 are payable directly from the pupil's account within the fund.
 41 12    d.  Conduct audits or other review necessary to properly

 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph

 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the

 40 15 program state cost per pupil for the same school year.
 40 16    b.  The department of management shall on July 1 following
 40 17 the determination of the amount of the education savings grant
 40 18 for each approved pupil transfer such amounts to the pupil's
 40 19 account in the education savings grant fund established under
 40 20 subsection 4.  Such amount shall be available to the pupil's
 40 21 parent or guardian in the manner authorized under subsection
 40 22 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that
 40 24 school year.
 40 25    4.  An education savings grant fund is created in the state
 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July
 40 30 1, 2018, and each succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated
 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all
 40 35 powers necessary to carry out and effectuate the purposes,

 41 13 administer the program.
 41 14    e.  Adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A for the
 41 15 administration of the fund and accounts within the fund.
 41 16    5.  a.  For each pupil approved for an education savings

 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".

 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.

 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the

 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately

 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under

 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.

 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all

 41 15 administration of the fund and accounts within the fund.
 41 16    5.  a.  For each pupil approved for an education savings
 41 17 grant, the department of management shall establish an account
 41 18 for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.  The
 41 19 amount of the pupil's education savings grant determined under
 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph

 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for

 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or

 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a

 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the

 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of

 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of

 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July

 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all

 41 11 are payable directly from the pupil's account within the fund.
 41 12    d.  Conduct audits or other review necessary to properly
 41 13 administer the program.

 41 18 for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.  The
 41 19 amount of the pupil's education savings grant determined under
 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the

 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for
 42  4 tutoring or cognitive skills training, curriculum materials,
 42  5 tuition or fees for nonpublic online education programs,
 42  6 education materials and services for pupils with disabilities,
 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the

 40 22 4, paragraph "c", for the payment of qualified educational
 40 23 expenses incurred by such persons for the pupil during that

 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings

 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the

 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used

 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for
 42  4 tutoring or cognitive skills training, curriculum materials,
 42  5 tuition or fees for nonpublic online education programs,
 42  6 education materials and services for pupils with disabilities,
 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the
 44  5 following new subsection:
 44  6     40 24 school year.
 40 25    4.  An education savings grant fund is created in the state
 40 26 treasury under the control of the department of management
 40 27 consisting of moneys appropriated to the department of
 40 28 management for the purpose of providing education savings
 40 29 grants under this section.  For the fiscal year commencing July
 40 30 1, 2018, and each succeeding fiscal year, there is appropriated
 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all
 40 35 powers necessary to carry out and effectuate the purposes,
 41  1 objectives, and provisions of this section pertaining to the
 41  2 fund, including the power to do all of the following:
 41  3    a.  Make and enter into contracts necessary for the
 41  4 administration of the fund.
 41  5    b.  Procure insurance against any loss in connection with the
 41  6 assets of the fund or require a surety bond.
 41  7    c.  Contract with a private financial management firm to
 41  8 manage the fund, in collaboration with the treasurer of state,
 41  9 including providing for the disbursement of education savings
 41 10 grants in the form of an electronic debit card or checks that
 41 11 are payable directly from the pupil's account within the fund.
 41 12    d.  Conduct audits or other review necessary to properly
 41 13 administer the program.
 41 14    e.  Adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A for the
 41 15 administration of the fund and accounts within the fund.
 41 16    5.  a.  For each pupil approved for an education savings
 41 17 grant, the department of management shall establish an account
 41 18 for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.  The
 41 19 amount of the pupil's education savings grant determined under
 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
 41 33 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified
 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for
 42  4 tutoring or cognitive skills training, curriculum materials,
 42  5 tuition or fees for nonpublic online education programs,
 42  6 education materials and services for pupils with disabilities,
 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.

 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings

 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,

 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings

 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including

 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for

 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,

 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the
 44  5 following new subsection:

 40 31 from the general fund of the state to the department of
 40 32 management to be credited to the fund the amount necessary
 40 33 to pay all education savings grants approved for that fiscal
 40 34 year.  The director of the department of management has all
 40 35 powers necessary to carry out and effectuate the purposes,
 41  1 objectives, and provisions of this section pertaining to the
 41  2 fund, including the power to do all of the following:
 41  3    a.  Make and enter into contracts necessary for the
 41  4 administration of the fund.
 41  5    b.  Procure insurance against any loss in connection with the
 41  6 assets of the fund or require a surety bond.
 41  7    c.  Contract with a private financial management firm to
 41  8 manage the fund, in collaboration with the treasurer of state,
 41  9 including providing for the disbursement of education savings
 41 10 grants in the form of an electronic debit card or checks that
 41 11 are payable directly from the pupil's account within the fund.
 41 12    d.  Conduct audits or other review necessary to properly
 41 13 administer the program.
 41 14    e.  Adopt rules pursuant to chapter 17A for the
 41 15 administration of the fund and accounts within the fund.
 41 16    5.  a.  For each pupil approved for an education savings
 41 17 grant, the department of management shall establish an account
 41 18 for that pupil in the education savings grant fund.  The
 41 19 amount of the pupil's education savings grant determined under
 41 20 subsection 3 shall be deposited into the pupil's account on
 41 21 July 1 and such amount shall be immediately available for the
 41 22 payment of qualified educational expenses incurred by the
 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
 41 33 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified
 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for
 42  4 tutoring or cognitive skills training, curriculum materials,
 42  5 tuition or fees for nonpublic online education programs,
 42  6 education materials and services for pupils with disabilities,
 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.

 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian

 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds

 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant

 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice

 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a

 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education

 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the

 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent

 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device

 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art

 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice

 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under

 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.

 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
 41 33 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified
 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational

 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,

 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise

 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent

 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.

 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school

 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for

 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing

 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the

 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,

 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns

 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.

 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation

 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.

 41 23 parent or guardian for the pupil during that fiscal year using
 41 24 the payment method authorized under subsection 4, paragraph
 41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings

 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the
 41 33 education savings grant fund for the payment of qualified
 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school

 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including

 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant

 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school

 42  5 tuition or fees for nonpublic online education programs,
 42  6 education materials and services for pupils with disabilities,
 42  7 standardized test fees, fees required by the department not to
 42  8 exceed for each grant recipient five percent of the total grant
 42  9 amount in any fiscal year, and other expenses incurred by the
 42 10 parent or guardian that are directly related to the education
 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including

 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,
 43 14 incurred by the pupil while attending an institution of higher
 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a

 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the
 44  5 following new subsection:
 44  6     41 25 "c".
 41 26    b.  A nonpublic school or a provider of competent private
 41 27 instruction that accepts payment from a parent or guardian
 41 28 using funds from a pupil's account in the education savings
 41 29 grant fund shall not refund, rebate, or share any portion of
 41 30 such payment with the parent, guardian, or pupil.
 41 31    c.  Moneys remaining in a pupil's account upon conclusion
 41 32 of the fiscal year shall remain in the pupil's account in the

 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent

 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's

 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,

 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent

 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant

 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the

 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant

 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the

 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately
 42 20 preceding fiscal years.  "Qualified educational expenses" do not
 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including

 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the
 43  4 education savings grant program in the future.
 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,

 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education

 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent

 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.

 41 34 educational expenses in future fiscal years or for the payment
 41 35 of higher education costs under subsection 8.
 42  1    6.  For purposes of this section, "qualified educational
 42  2 expenses" includes tuition and fees at a nonpublic school
 42  3 or nonpublic preschool, textbooks, fees or payments for
 42  4 tutoring or cognitive skills training, curriculum materials,

 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds
 42 19 from that pupil's account in either of the two immediately

 42 21 include transportation costs for the pupil, the cost of food
 42 22 or refreshments consumed by the pupil, the cost of clothing
 42 23 for the pupil, or the cost of disposable materials including
 42 24 but not limited to paper, notebooks, pencils, pens, and art
 42 25 supplies.
 42 26    7.  A person who makes a false claim for the purpose
 42 27 of obtaining an education savings grant provided for in
 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for

 43  5    8.  For each pupil with a positive balance in the pupil's
 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the
 43  9 department of management shall maintain such account in the
 43 10 fund until the pupil is twenty=five years of age. Following
 43 11 graduation from high school until the pupil is twenty=five
 43 12 years of age, moneys in the pupil's account may be used
 43 13 for higher education costs, as defined in section 12D.1,

 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require
 43 27 a nonpublic school to modify its standards for admission or
 43 28 educational program in order to receive payment from a parent
 43 29 or guardian using funds from a pupil's account in the education
 43 30 savings grant fund. A nonpublic school or provider of
 43 31 competent private instruction under chapter 299A that accepts
 43 32 payment from a parent or guardian using funds from a pupil's
 43 33 account in the education savings grant fund is not an agent
 43 34 of this state or of a political subdivision of this state.
 43 35 Rules adopted by the department of management to implement this
 44  1 section that impose an undue burden on a nonpublic school or
 44  2 provider of competent private instruction under chapter 299A
 44  3 are invalid.
 44  4    Sec. 86.  Section 422.7, Code 2017, is amended by adding the

 42 11 of the pupil at a nonpublic preschool or a nonpublic school,
 42 12 including a nonpublic school accredited by an independent
 42 13 accrediting agency approved by the department of management, or
 42 14 directly related to providing competent private instruction for
 42 15 the pupil under chapter 299A or private preschool instruction.
 42 16 The cost of one computer or other portable computing device
 42 17 shall be allowed as a qualified educational expense for
 42 18 a pupil if such a purchase has not been made using funds

 42 28 this section or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a
 42 29 payment from an account within the education savings grant
 42 30 fund without being legally entitled to do so is guilty of a
 42 31 fraudulent practice under chapter 714.  The false claim for an
 42 32 education savings grant or a payment from an account shall be
 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the
 42 35 department of management shall initiate legal proceedings to
 43  1 recover such amounts. A parent or guardian, or a pupil for
 43  2 purposes of subsection 8, who commits a fraudulent practice
 43  3 under this subsection is prohibited from participating in the

 43  6 account in the education savings grant fund upon graduation
 43  7 from high school or completion of an equivalent level of
 43  8 competent private instruction under chapter 299A, the

 43 15 education under the control of the state board of regents, a
 43 16 community college located in this state, or a private college
 43 17 or university located in this state. Payments from a pupil's
 43 18 account for higher education costs shall be made in the same
 43 19 manner as payments for qualified educational expenses under
 43 20 subsection 5. Moneys in a pupil's account when the pupil turns
 43 21 twenty=five years of age shall be transferred by the department
 43 22 of management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 43 23    9.  This section shall not be construed to authorize the
 43 24 state or any political subdivision of the state to exercise
 43 25 authority over any nonpublic school or provider of competent
 43 26 private instruction under chapter 299A or construed to require

 42 33 disallowed. If amounts from the grant have been disbursed from
 42 34 the applicable account in the education savings grant fund, the

 48  9 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
 48 10 graduation from high school or completion of an equivalent
 48 11 level of competent private instruction under Code chapter
 48 12 299A, the department of management is required to maintain the
 48 13 account in the fund until the pupil is 25 years old.  Until
 48 14 the pupil is 25 years old, moneys in the pupil's account may
 48 15 be used by the pupil for higher education costs, as defined
 48 16 in Code section 12D.1.  Moneys in a pupil's account when the

 48 20 false claim for the purpose of obtaining an education savings
 48 21 grant or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a payment
 48 22 from an account within the education savings grant fund without

 48 24 practice and is subject to a criminal penalty.  The bill allows
 48 25 the department of management to initiate legal proceedings to
 48 26 recover grants and amounts improperly awarded or paid from
 48 27 accounts under the bill.
 48 28    Division III of the bill provides that an education savings

 47 14 grant fund in the state treasury under the control of the

 47 19 fund of the state to the department of management for deposit

 47 24 savings grant fund.  The amount of the pupil's education
 47 25 savings grant is deposited into the pupil's account on July 1

 47 35 electronic debit card or checks that are payable directly from
 48  1 the pupil's account within the fund.
 48  2    Division III of the bill provides that moneys remaining in a
 48  3 pupil's account upon the conclusion of the fiscal year shall
 48  4 remain in the pupil's account within the education savings
 48  5 grant fund for the payment of qualified educational expenses in
 48  6 future fiscal years or for higher education costs as authorized
 48  7 in the bill.
 48  8    Under the division, for each pupil with a positive balance in
 48  9 the pupil's account in the education savings grant fund upon
 48 10 graduation from high school or completion of an equivalent
 48 11 level of competent private instruction under Code chapter
 48 12 299A, the department of management is required to maintain the
 48 13 account in the fund until the pupil is 25 years old.  Until
 48 14 the pupil is 25 years old, moneys in the pupil's account may
 48 15 be used by the pupil for higher education costs, as defined
 48 16 in Code section 12D.1.  Moneys in a pupil's account when the

 48 18 management for deposit in the general fund of the state.
 48 19    Division III of the bill provides that a person who makes a

 48 21 grant or who knowingly receives the grant or makes a payment
 48 22 from an account within the education savings grant fund without

 48 24 practice and is subject to a criminal penalty.  The bill allows
 48 25 the department of management to initiate legal proceedings to
 48 26 recover grants and amounts improperly awarded or paid from
 48 27 accounts under the bill.
 48 28    Division III of the bill provides that an education savings

 48 11 level of competent private instruction under Code chapter
