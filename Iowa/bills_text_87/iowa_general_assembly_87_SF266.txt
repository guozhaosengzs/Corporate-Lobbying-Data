  6 14                           EXPLANATION
  6 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 17    This bill relates to marijuana and cannabidiol by modifying
  6 18 penalties and creating a drug court revolving fund.
  6 19    The bill strikes provisions relating to the possession
  6 20 of marijuana in Code section 124.401(5) and creates new
  6 21 Code section 124.401G relating to marijuana possession.  The
  6 22 bill also strikes a provision relating to the lawful use of
  6 23 cannabidiol in Code section 124.401(5), and moves the provision
  6 24 to new Code section 124.401G.  Cannabidiol is a derivative
  6 25 of marijuana and is punished as if one possessed or used the
  6 26 controlled substance of marijuana, except that prosecutions
  6 27 related to cannabidiol are limited under Code chapter 124D
  6 28 (medical cannabidiol Act).
  6 29    ACCOMMODATION OFFENSE.   The bill makes a conforming change
  6 30 to Code section 124.410, but does not change the criminal
  6 31 penalties for an accommodation offense.
  6 32    JUVENILE POSSESSION.   The bill punishes a juvenile who
  6 33 possesses marijuana differently than a person 18 years of
  6 34 age or older who possesses marijuana.  The bill modifies
  6 35 the definition of "delinquent act" to include possession of
  7  1 marijuana and specifies that a juvenile who possesses marijuana
  7  2 commits a delinquent act to be adjudicated exclusively in
  7  3 juvenile court.  However, the bill provides that a juvenile
  7  4 who possesses marijuana shall not be held in detention.
  7  5 Code section 232.2(15) defines "detention" to mean the
  7  6 temporary care of a child in a physically restricting facility
  7  7 designed to ensure the continued custody of the child at any
  7  8 point between the child's initial contact with the juvenile
  7  9 authorities and the final disposition of the child's case.
  7 10    POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA == CIVIL PENALTIES == OFFENSES.
  7 11  The bill creates a new civil penalty for the possession of
  7 12 one ounce or less of marijuana.  Under the bill, a person who
  7 13 unlawfully possesses one ounce or less of marijuana does not
  7 14 commit a criminal offense but shall be subject to the following
  7 15 civil penalty: $50 for a first offense, $100 for a second
  7 16 offense, and $200 for a third or subsequent offense.
  7 17    The bill specifies that a previous conviction involving
  7 18 possession of marijuana under current Code section 124.401(5)
  7 19 or possession of more than one ounce of marijuana in violation
  7 20 of the bill shall also be counted as a previous offense.
  7 21    The bill provides that any records relating to the civil
  7 22 penalty shall not be displayed for public viewing on the Iowa
  7 23 court information system.  However, the bill does specify
  7 24 that the judicial branch shall allow a county attorney
  7 25 viewing access to the Iowa court information for purposes of
  7 26 determining the number of previous marijuana offenses the
  7 27 person has had in order to determine the amount of the civil
  7 28 penalty to be assessed.
  7 29    The bill provides that any records relating to the civil
  7 30 penalty shall not be kept in the criminal history data files
  7 31 maintained by the department of public safety.  The bill
  7 32 further states any records relating to the civil penalty shall
  7 33 not be disseminated to other criminal or juvenile justice
  7 34 agencies.
  7 35    The bill does not change the criminal penalties related to
  8  1 the possession of more than one ounce of marijuana.  Under
  8  2 current law and the bill, a person who unlawfully possesses
  8  3 more than one ounce of marijuana commits the following: for
  8  4 a first offense, the punishment shall be by imprisonment in
  8  5 the county jail for not more than six months or by a fine of
  8  6 not more than $1,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment;
  8  7 for a second offense, the punishment shall be imprisonment
  8  8 not to exceed one year and a fine of at least $315 but not
  8  9 more than $1,875; and for a third or subsequent offense, the
  8 10 person commits an aggravated misdemeanor which is punishable by
  8 11 confinement for no more than two years and a fine of at least
  8 12 $625 but not more than $6,250.
  8 13    However, the bill does change the penalties related to
  8 14 the driving privileges of a person convicted of possession
  8 15 of marijuana.  Currently, the driver's license of a person
  8 16 convicted of possession of marijuana is revoked for 180 days at
  8 17 sentencing.  By moving the possession penalties for marijuana
  8 18 to new Code section 124.401G under the bill, the driver's
  8 19 license of a person convicted of possession of marijuana is no
  8 20 longer revoked pursuant to Code section 901.5(10).
  8 21    CANNABIDIOL.  The bill does not change the cannabidiol
  8 22 provision moved from Code section 124.104(5) to new Code
  8 23 section 124.401G.  Under current law and the bill, a person
  8 24 may knowingly or intentionally recommend, possess, use,
  8 25 dispense, deliver, transport, or administer cannabidiol if
  8 26 the recommendation, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
  8 27 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
  8 28 provisions of Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act). The
  8 29 bill does not extend the repeal of Code chapter 124D beyond
  8 30 July 1, 2017.
  8 31    GATHERINGS WHERE MARIJUANA IS USED.   The bill strikes a
  8 32 provision in Code section 124.407 that makes it unlawful for
  8 33 any person to sponsor, promote, or aid, or assist in the
  8 34 sponsoring or promoting of a gathering of people with the
  8 35 knowledge or intent that marijuana will be distributed, used,
  9  1 or possessed at such a gathering. A person who violates this
  9  2 provision under current law commits a serious misdemeanor.
  9  3    DRUG COURT REVOLVING FUND.  The bill creates a drug court
  9  4 revolving fund in the state treasury under the control of the
  9  5 judicial branch.  The fund shall consist of moneys deposited
  9  6 into the fund from civil penalties assessed for offenses
  9  7 involving one ounce or less of marijuana, and appropriations
  9  8 made to the fund.  The bill requires that moneys in the fund
  9  9 be used by the judicial branch to establish, administer, and
  9 10 maintain drug courts throughout the state.
  9 11    The bill provides that unencumbered and unobligated receipts
  9 12 in the drug court revolving fund at the end of a fiscal year
  9 13 do not revert to the general fund of the state. The bill also
  9 14 provides that interest or earnings on moneys deposited in the
  9 15 drug court revolving fund shall be credited to the fund.
  9 16    The bill also requires the judicial branch to file, on or
  9 17 before February 1 of each year, a financial accounting of the
  9 18 moneys in the drug court revolving fund with the legislative
  9 19 services agency.
  9 20    FORFEITURE.   The bill provides that a person who violates the
  9 21 bill by possessing 1 ounce or less of marijuana (civil penalty)
  9 22 shall not be subject to forfeiture of certain property pursuant
  9 23 to Code section 809A.4, except that the marijuana shall be
  9 24 seized and forfeited.

  8 22 provision moved from Code section 124.104(5) to new Code
  8 23 section 124.401G.  Under current law and the bill, a person
  8 24 may knowingly or intentionally recommend, possess, use,
  8 25 dispense, deliver, transport, or administer cannabidiol if
  8 26 the recommendation, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
  8 27 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
  8 28 provisions of Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act). The
  8 29 bill does not extend the repeal of Code chapter 124D beyond
  8 30 July 1, 2017.
  8 31    GATHERINGS WHERE MARIJUANA IS USED.   The bill strikes a
  8 32 provision in Code section 124.407 that makes it unlawful for
  8 33 any person to sponsor, promote, or aid, or assist in the
  8 34 sponsoring or promoting of a gathering of people with the
  8 35 knowledge or intent that marijuana will be distributed, used,
  9  1 or possessed at such a gathering. A person who violates this
  9  2 provision under current law commits a serious misdemeanor.
  9  3    DRUG COURT REVOLVING FUND.  The bill creates a drug court
  9  4 revolving fund in the state treasury under the control of the
  9  5 judicial branch.  The fund shall consist of moneys deposited
  9  6 into the fund from civil penalties assessed for offenses
  9  7 involving one ounce or less of marijuana, and appropriations
  9  8 made to the fund.  The bill requires that moneys in the fund
  9  9 be used by the judicial branch to establish, administer, and
  9 10 maintain drug courts throughout the state.
  9 11    The bill provides that unencumbered and unobligated receipts
  9 12 in the drug court revolving fund at the end of a fiscal year
  9 13 do not revert to the general fund of the state. The bill also
  9 14 provides that interest or earnings on moneys deposited in the
  9 15 drug court revolving fund shall be credited to the fund.
  9 16    The bill also requires the judicial branch to file, on or

  9 18 moneys in the drug court revolving fund with the legislative
  9 19 services agency.

  6 15 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6 16 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6 17    This bill relates to marijuana and cannabidiol by modifying
  6 18 penalties and creating a drug court revolving fund.
  6 19    The bill strikes provisions relating to the possession
  6 20 of marijuana in Code section 124.401(5) and creates new
  6 21 Code section 124.401G relating to marijuana possession.  The
  6 22 bill also strikes a provision relating to the lawful use of
  6 23 cannabidiol in Code section 124.401(5), and moves the provision
  6 24 to new Code section 124.401G.  Cannabidiol is a derivative
  6 25 of marijuana and is punished as if one possessed or used the
  6 26 controlled substance of marijuana, except that prosecutions
  6 27 related to cannabidiol are limited under Code chapter 124D
  6 28 (medical cannabidiol Act).
  6 29    ACCOMMODATION OFFENSE.   The bill makes a conforming change
  6 30 to Code section 124.410, but does not change the criminal
  6 31 penalties for an accommodation offense.
  6 32    JUVENILE POSSESSION.   The bill punishes a juvenile who
  6 33 possesses marijuana differently than a person 18 years of
  6 34 age or older who possesses marijuana.  The bill modifies
  6 35 the definition of "delinquent act" to include possession of
  7  1 marijuana and specifies that a juvenile who possesses marijuana
  7  2 commits a delinquent act to be adjudicated exclusively in
  7  3 juvenile court.  However, the bill provides that a juvenile
  7  4 who possesses marijuana shall not be held in detention.
  7  5 Code section 232.2(15) defines "detention" to mean the
  7  6 temporary care of a child in a physically restricting facility
  7  7 designed to ensure the continued custody of the child at any
  7  8 point between the child's initial contact with the juvenile
  7  9 authorities and the final disposition of the child's case.
  7 10    POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA == CIVIL PENALTIES == OFFENSES.
  7 11  The bill creates a new civil penalty for the possession of
  7 12 one ounce or less of marijuana.  Under the bill, a person who
  7 13 unlawfully possesses one ounce or less of marijuana does not
  7 14 commit a criminal offense but shall be subject to the following
  7 15 civil penalty: $50 for a first offense, $100 for a second
  7 16 offense, and $200 for a third or subsequent offense.
  7 17    The bill specifies that a previous conviction involving
  7 18 possession of marijuana under current Code section 124.401(5)
  7 19 or possession of more than one ounce of marijuana in violation
  7 20 of the bill shall also be counted as a previous offense.
  7 21    The bill provides that any records relating to the civil
  7 22 penalty shall not be displayed for public viewing on the Iowa
  7 23 court information system.  However, the bill does specify
  7 24 that the judicial branch shall allow a county attorney
  7 25 viewing access to the Iowa court information for purposes of
  7 26 determining the number of previous marijuana offenses the
  7 27 person has had in order to determine the amount of the civil
  7 28 penalty to be assessed.
  7 29    The bill provides that any records relating to the civil
  7 30 penalty shall not be kept in the criminal history data files
  7 31 maintained by the department of public safety.  The bill
  7 32 further states any records relating to the civil penalty shall
  7 33 not be disseminated to other criminal or juvenile justice
  7 34 agencies.
  7 35    The bill does not change the criminal penalties related to
  8  1 the possession of more than one ounce of marijuana.  Under
  8  2 current law and the bill, a person who unlawfully possesses
  8  3 more than one ounce of marijuana commits the following: for
  8  4 a first offense, the punishment shall be by imprisonment in
  8  5 the county jail for not more than six months or by a fine of
  8  6 not more than $1,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment;
  8  7 for a second offense, the punishment shall be imprisonment
  8  8 not to exceed one year and a fine of at least $315 but not
  8  9 more than $1,875; and for a third or subsequent offense, the
  8 10 person commits an aggravated misdemeanor which is punishable by
  8 11 confinement for no more than two years and a fine of at least
  8 12 $625 but not more than $6,250.
  8 13    However, the bill does change the penalties related to
  8 14 the driving privileges of a person convicted of possession
  8 15 of marijuana.  Currently, the driver's license of a person
  8 16 convicted of possession of marijuana is revoked for 180 days at
  8 17 sentencing.  By moving the possession penalties for marijuana
  8 18 to new Code section 124.401G under the bill, the driver's
  8 19 license of a person convicted of possession of marijuana is no
  8 20 longer revoked pursuant to Code section 901.5(10).
  8 21    CANNABIDIOL.  The bill does not change the cannabidiol
  8 22 provision moved from Code section 124.104(5) to new Code
  8 23 section 124.401G.  Under current law and the bill, a person
  8 24 may knowingly or intentionally recommend, possess, use,
  8 25 dispense, deliver, transport, or administer cannabidiol if
  8 26 the recommendation, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
  8 27 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
  8 28 provisions of Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act). The
  8 29 bill does not extend the repeal of Code chapter 124D beyond
  8 30 July 1, 2017.
  8 31    GATHERINGS WHERE MARIJUANA IS USED.   The bill strikes a
  8 32 provision in Code section 124.407 that makes it unlawful for
  8 33 any person to sponsor, promote, or aid, or assist in the
  8 34 sponsoring or promoting of a gathering of people with the
  8 35 knowledge or intent that marijuana will be distributed, used,
  9  1 or possessed at such a gathering. A person who violates this
  9  2 provision under current law commits a serious misdemeanor.
  9  3    DRUG COURT REVOLVING FUND.  The bill creates a drug court
  9  4 revolving fund in the state treasury under the control of the
  9  5 judicial branch.  The fund shall consist of moneys deposited
  9  6 into the fund from civil penalties assessed for offenses
  9  7 involving one ounce or less of marijuana, and appropriations
  9  8 made to the fund.  The bill requires that moneys in the fund
  9  9 be used by the judicial branch to establish, administer, and
  9 10 maintain drug courts throughout the state.
  9 11    The bill provides that unencumbered and unobligated receipts
  9 12 in the drug court revolving fund at the end of a fiscal year
  9 13 do not revert to the general fund of the state. The bill also
  9 14 provides that interest or earnings on moneys deposited in the
  9 15 drug court revolving fund shall be credited to the fund.
  9 16    The bill also requires the judicial branch to file, on or
  9 17 before February 1 of each year, a financial accounting of the
  9 18 moneys in the drug court revolving fund with the legislative
  9 19 services agency.
  9 20    FORFEITURE.   The bill provides that a person who violates the
  9 21 bill by possessing 1 ounce or less of marijuana (civil penalty)
  9 22 shall not be subject to forfeiture of certain property pursuant
  9 23 to Code section 809A.4, except that the marijuana shall be
  9 24 seized and forfeited.

  6 20 of marijuana in Code section 124.401(5) and creates new

  6 22 bill also strikes a provision relating to the lawful use of
  6 23 cannabidiol in Code section 124.401(5), and moves the provision
  6 24 to new Code section 124.401G.  Cannabidiol is a derivative
  6 25 of marijuana and is punished as if one possessed or used the
  6 26 controlled substance of marijuana, except that prosecutions

  7  1 marijuana and specifies that a juvenile who possesses marijuana
  7  2 commits a delinquent act to be adjudicated exclusively in
  7  3 juvenile court.  However, the bill provides that a juvenile
  7  4 who possesses marijuana shall not be held in detention.
  7  5 Code section 232.2(15) defines "detention" to mean the

  7 10    POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA == CIVIL PENALTIES == OFFENSES.
  7 11  The bill creates a new civil penalty for the possession of
  7 12 one ounce or less of marijuana.  Under the bill, a person who
  7 13 unlawfully possesses one ounce or less of marijuana does not
  7 14 commit a criminal offense but shall be subject to the following
  7 15 civil penalty: $50 for a first offense, $100 for a second
  7 16 offense, and $200 for a third or subsequent offense.
  7 17    The bill specifies that a previous conviction involving
  7 18 possession of marijuana under current Code section 124.401(5)

  7 21    The bill provides that any records relating to the civil

  7 28 penalty to be assessed.
  7 29    The bill provides that any records relating to the civil
  7 30 penalty shall not be kept in the criminal history data files

  7 33 not be disseminated to other criminal or juvenile justice
  7 34 agencies.
  7 35    The bill does not change the criminal penalties related to

  6 25 of marijuana and is punished as if one possessed or used the
  6 26 controlled substance of marijuana, except that prosecutions
  6 27 related to cannabidiol are limited under Code chapter 124D
  6 28 (medical cannabidiol Act).
  6 29    ACCOMMODATION OFFENSE.   The bill makes a conforming change
  6 30 to Code section 124.410, but does not change the criminal
  6 31 penalties for an accommodation offense.
  6 32    JUVENILE POSSESSION.   The bill punishes a juvenile who
  6 33 possesses marijuana differently than a person 18 years of
  6 34 age or older who possesses marijuana.  The bill modifies
  6 35 the definition of "delinquent act" to include possession of
  7  1 marijuana and specifies that a juvenile who possesses marijuana
  7  2 commits a delinquent act to be adjudicated exclusively in
  7  3 juvenile court.  However, the bill provides that a juvenile
  7  4 who possesses marijuana shall not be held in detention.
  7  5 Code section 232.2(15) defines "detention" to mean the
  7  6 temporary care of a child in a physically restricting facility
  7  7 designed to ensure the continued custody of the child at any
  7  8 point between the child's initial contact with the juvenile
  7  9 authorities and the final disposition of the child's case.
  7 10    POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA == CIVIL PENALTIES == OFFENSES.
  7 11  The bill creates a new civil penalty for the possession of
  7 12 one ounce or less of marijuana.  Under the bill, a person who
  7 13 unlawfully possesses one ounce or less of marijuana does not
  7 14 commit a criminal offense but shall be subject to the following
  7 15 civil penalty: $50 for a first offense, $100 for a second
  7 16 offense, and $200 for a third or subsequent offense.
  7 17    The bill specifies that a previous conviction involving
  7 18 possession of marijuana under current Code section 124.401(5)
  7 19 or possession of more than one ounce of marijuana in violation
  7 20 of the bill shall also be counted as a previous offense.
  7 21    The bill provides that any records relating to the civil
  7 22 penalty shall not be displayed for public viewing on the Iowa
  7 23 court information system.  However, the bill does specify
  7 24 that the judicial branch shall allow a county attorney
  7 25 viewing access to the Iowa court information for purposes of
  7 26 determining the number of previous marijuana offenses the
  7 27 person has had in order to determine the amount of the civil
  7 28 penalty to be assessed.
  7 29    The bill provides that any records relating to the civil
  7 30 penalty shall not be kept in the criminal history data files
  7 31 maintained by the department of public safety.  The bill
  7 32 further states any records relating to the civil penalty shall
  7 33 not be disseminated to other criminal or juvenile justice
  7 34 agencies.
  7 35    The bill does not change the criminal penalties related to
  8  1 the possession of more than one ounce of marijuana.  Under
  8  2 current law and the bill, a person who unlawfully possesses
  8  3 more than one ounce of marijuana commits the following: for
  8  4 a first offense, the punishment shall be by imprisonment in
  8  5 the county jail for not more than six months or by a fine of
  8  6 not more than $1,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment;
  8  7 for a second offense, the punishment shall be imprisonment
  8  8 not to exceed one year and a fine of at least $315 but not
  8  9 more than $1,875; and for a third or subsequent offense, the
  8 10 person commits an aggravated misdemeanor which is punishable by
  8 11 confinement for no more than two years and a fine of at least
  8 12 $625 but not more than $6,250.
  8 13    However, the bill does change the penalties related to
  8 14 the driving privileges of a person convicted of possession
  8 15 of marijuana.  Currently, the driver's license of a person
  8 16 convicted of possession of marijuana is revoked for 180 days at
  8 17 sentencing.  By moving the possession penalties for marijuana
  8 18 to new Code section 124.401G under the bill, the driver's
  8 19 license of a person convicted of possession of marijuana is no
  8 20 longer revoked pursuant to Code section 901.5(10).
  8 21    CANNABIDIOL.  The bill does not change the cannabidiol
  8 22 provision moved from Code section 124.104(5) to new Code
  8 23 section 124.401G.  Under current law and the bill, a person
  8 24 may knowingly or intentionally recommend, possess, use,
  8 25 dispense, deliver, transport, or administer cannabidiol if
  8 26 the recommendation, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
  8 27 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
  8 28 provisions of Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act). The
  8 29 bill does not extend the repeal of Code chapter 124D beyond
  8 30 July 1, 2017.
  8 31    GATHERINGS WHERE MARIJUANA IS USED.   The bill strikes a
  8 32 provision in Code section 124.407 that makes it unlawful for
  8 33 any person to sponsor, promote, or aid, or assist in the
  8 34 sponsoring or promoting of a gathering of people with the
  8 35 knowledge or intent that marijuana will be distributed, used,
  9  1 or possessed at such a gathering. A person who violates this
  9  2 provision under current law commits a serious misdemeanor.
  9  3    DRUG COURT REVOLVING FUND.  The bill creates a drug court
  9  4 revolving fund in the state treasury under the control of the
  9  5 judicial branch.  The fund shall consist of moneys deposited
  9  6 into the fund from civil penalties assessed for offenses
  9  7 involving one ounce or less of marijuana, and appropriations
  9  8 made to the fund.  The bill requires that moneys in the fund
  9  9 be used by the judicial branch to establish, administer, and
  9 10 maintain drug courts throughout the state.
  9 11    The bill provides that unencumbered and unobligated receipts
  9 12 in the drug court revolving fund at the end of a fiscal year
  9 13 do not revert to the general fund of the state. The bill also
  9 14 provides that interest or earnings on moneys deposited in the
  9 15 drug court revolving fund shall be credited to the fund.
  9 16    The bill also requires the judicial branch to file, on or
  9 17 before February 1 of each year, a financial accounting of the
  9 18 moneys in the drug court revolving fund with the legislative
  9 19 services agency.
  9 20    FORFEITURE.   The bill provides that a person who violates the
  9 21 bill by possessing 1 ounce or less of marijuana (civil penalty)
  9 22 shall not be subject to forfeiture of certain property pursuant
  9 23 to Code section 809A.4, except that the marijuana shall be
  9 24 seized and forfeited.

  6 22 bill also strikes a provision relating to the lawful use of
  6 23 cannabidiol in Code section 124.401(5), and moves the provision
  6 24 to new Code section 124.401G.  Cannabidiol is a derivative

  7 33 not be disseminated to other criminal or juvenile justice
  7 34 agencies.
  7 35    The bill does not change the criminal penalties related to

  8 16 convicted of possession of marijuana is revoked for 180 days at
  8 17 sentencing.  By moving the possession penalties for marijuana
  8 18 to new Code section 124.401G under the bill, the driver's
  8 19 license of a person convicted of possession of marijuana is no
  8 20 longer revoked pursuant to Code section 901.5(10).

  8 25 dispense, deliver, transport, or administer cannabidiol if
  8 26 the recommendation, possession, use, dispensing, delivery,
  8 27 transporting, or administering is in accordance with the
  8 28 provisions of Code chapter 124D (medical cannabidiol Act). The
  8 29 bill does not extend the repeal of Code chapter 124D beyond
  8 30 July 1, 2017.
  8 31    GATHERINGS WHERE MARIJUANA IS USED.   The bill strikes a
  8 32 provision in Code section 124.407 that makes it unlawful for
  8 33 any person to sponsor, promote, or aid, or assist in the
  8 34 sponsoring or promoting of a gathering of people with the
  8 35 knowledge or intent that marijuana will be distributed, used,
  9  1 or possessed at such a gathering. A person who violates this

  9  3    DRUG COURT REVOLVING FUND.  The bill creates a drug court
  9  4 revolving fund in the state treasury under the control of the
  9  5 judicial branch.  The fund shall consist of moneys deposited
  9  6 into the fund from civil penalties assessed for offenses
  9  7 involving one ounce or less of marijuana, and appropriations
  9  8 made to the fund.  The bill requires that moneys in the fund
  9  9 be used by the judicial branch to establish, administer, and

  6 23 cannabidiol in Code section 124.401(5), and moves the provision
  6 24 to new Code section 124.401G.  Cannabidiol is a derivative
  6 25 of marijuana and is punished as if one possessed or used the
  6 26 controlled substance of marijuana, except that prosecutions
  6 27 related to cannabidiol are limited under Code chapter 124D

  6 33 possesses marijuana differently than a person 18 years of
  6 34 age or older who possesses marijuana.  The bill modifies
  6 35 the definition of "delinquent act" to include possession of
  7  1 marijuana and specifies that a juvenile who possesses marijuana
  7  2 commits a delinquent act to be adjudicated exclusively in
  7  3 juvenile court.  However, the bill provides that a juvenile
  7  4 who possesses marijuana shall not be held in detention.
  7  5 Code section 232.2(15) defines "detention" to mean the

  7  8 point between the child's initial contact with the juvenile
  7  9 authorities and the final disposition of the child's case.
  7 10    POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA == CIVIL PENALTIES == OFFENSES.
  7 11  The bill creates a new civil penalty for the possession of
  7 12 one ounce or less of marijuana.  Under the bill, a person who
  7 13 unlawfully possesses one ounce or less of marijuana does not
  7 14 commit a criminal offense but shall be subject to the following
  7 15 civil penalty: $50 for a first offense, $100 for a second
  7 16 offense, and $200 for a third or subsequent offense.
  7 17    The bill specifies that a previous conviction involving
  7 18 possession of marijuana under current Code section 124.401(5)
  7 19 or possession of more than one ounce of marijuana in violation
  7 20 of the bill shall also be counted as a previous offense.
  7 21    The bill provides that any records relating to the civil
  7 22 penalty shall not be displayed for public viewing on the Iowa
  7 23 court information system.  However, the bill does specify
  7 24 that the judicial branch shall allow a county attorney
  7 25 viewing access to the Iowa court information for purposes of
  7 26 determining the number of previous marijuana offenses the
  7 27 person has had in order to determine the amount of the civil
  7 28 penalty to be assessed.
  7 29    The bill provides that any records relating to the civil
  7 30 penalty shall not be kept in the criminal history data files
  7 31 maintained by the department of public safety.  The bill
  7 32 further states any records relating to the civil penalty shall
  7 33 not be disseminated to other criminal or juvenile justice
  7 34 agencies.
  7 35    The bill does not change the criminal penalties related to
  8  1 the possession of more than one ounce of marijuana.  Under
  8  2 current law and the bill, a person who unlawfully possesses
  8  3 more than one ounce of marijuana commits the following: for
  8  4 a first offense, the punishment shall be by imprisonment in
  8  5 the county jail for not more than six months or by a fine of
  8  6 not more than $1,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment;
  8  7 for a second offense, the punishment shall be imprisonment
  8  8 not to exceed one year and a fine of at least $315 but not
  8  9 more than $1,875; and for a third or subsequent offense, the
  8 10 person commits an aggravated misdemeanor which is punishable by
  8 11 confinement for no more than two years and a fine of at least
  8 12 $625 but not more than $6,250.
  8 13    However, the bill does change the penalties related to
  8 14 the driving privileges of a person convicted of possession
  8 15 of marijuana.  Currently, the driver's license of a person
  8 16 convicted of possession of marijuana is revoked for 180 days at
  8 17 sentencing.  By moving the possession penalties for marijuana
  8 18 to new Code section 124.401G under the bill, the driver's
  8 19 license of a person convicted of possession of marijuana is no
  8 20 longer revoked pursuant to Code section 901.5(10).

  8 22 provision moved from Code section 124.104(5) to new Code

  7 13 unlawfully possesses one ounce or less of marijuana does not
  7 14 commit a criminal offense but shall be subject to the following
  7 15 civil penalty: $50 for a first offense, $100 for a second
  7 16 offense, and $200 for a third or subsequent offense.
  7 17    The bill specifies that a previous conviction involving
  7 18 possession of marijuana under current Code section 124.401(5)
  7 19 or possession of more than one ounce of marijuana in violation
  7 20 of the bill shall also be counted as a previous offense.
  7 21    The bill provides that any records relating to the civil
  7 22 penalty shall not be displayed for public viewing on the Iowa

  8  7 for a second offense, the punishment shall be imprisonment
  8  8 not to exceed one year and a fine of at least $315 but not
  8  9 more than $1,875; and for a third or subsequent offense, the
  8 10 person commits an aggravated misdemeanor which is punishable by

  8 15 of marijuana.  Currently, the driver's license of a person
  8 16 convicted of possession of marijuana is revoked for 180 days at

  8 33 any person to sponsor, promote, or aid, or assist in the
  8 34 sponsoring or promoting of a gathering of people with the

  7 13 unlawfully possesses one ounce or less of marijuana does not
  7 14 commit a criminal offense but shall be subject to the following
  7 15 civil penalty: $50 for a first offense, $100 for a second
  7 16 offense, and $200 for a third or subsequent offense.
  7 17    The bill specifies that a previous conviction involving
  7 18 possession of marijuana under current Code section 124.401(5)

  7 20 of the bill shall also be counted as a previous offense.
  7 21    The bill provides that any records relating to the civil
  7 22 penalty shall not be displayed for public viewing on the Iowa
  7 23 court information system.  However, the bill does specify

  8  4 a first offense, the punishment shall be by imprisonment in
  8  5 the county jail for not more than six months or by a fine of
  8  6 not more than $1,000, or by both such fine and imprisonment;
  8  7 for a second offense, the punishment shall be imprisonment
  8  8 not to exceed one year and a fine of at least $315 but not
  8  9 more than $1,875; and for a third or subsequent offense, the

  9  8 made to the fund.  The bill requires that moneys in the fund
  9  9 be used by the judicial branch to establish, administer, and
