  5 33                           EXPLANATION
  5 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  1 This bill relates to property taxation by modifying
  6  2 provisions relating to assessment and exemption of certain
  6  3 property, modifying provisions relating to property assessment
  6  4 appeals, and providing for the reimbursement of certain appeal
  6  5 costs.
  6  6    Current law provides an exemption from property taxation
  6  7 for dwelling unit property owned and managed by a nonprofit
  6  8 community housing development organization if the organization
  6  9 owns and manages more than 150 dwelling units located in a city
  6 10 with a population of more than 110,000. The bill authorizes a
  6 11 similar property tax exemption for assessment years beginning
  6 12 on or after January 1, 2019, for dwelling unit property that
  6 13 is constructed or substantially rehabilitated on or after July
  6 14 1, 2018, if the property is owned, managed, or controlled
  6 15 by a community housing development organization that owns
  6 16 and manages more than 150 dwelling units. The exemption
  6 17 established in the bill does not include a city population
  6 18 requirement and provides that the exemption is allowed for
  6 19 each eligible property unless specifically disapproved by the
  6 20 city if located in a city or the county if located in the
  6 21 unincorporated area of a county.
  6 22    The bill modifies provisions relating to even=numbered
  6 23 assessment years by providing that the assessor shall value
  6 24 and assess or revalue and reassess, as the case may require,
  6 25 any individual real estate parcel that the assessor finds was
  6 26 assessed for more than the value authorized by law or was not
  6 27 listed in the assessment year immediately preceding, and any
  6 28 real estate the assessor finds has changed in value subsequent
  6 29 to January 1 of the preceding real estate assessment year
  6 30 based on buildings erected, improvements made, or buildings or
  6 31 improvements removed in a year after the assessment. The bill
  6 32 also provides that a percentage increase for an even=numbered
  6 33 assessment year shall be applied to all property within the
  6 34 class and shall not be applied only to a subset of the class
  6 35 unless approved by the department of revenue.
  7  1 Current Code section 441.21(3) specifies a burden of proof
  7  2 for taxpayer protests or appeals of property assessments made
  7  3 by local assessors.  The current standard for assessment years
  7  4 beginning on or after January 1, 2018, is that the burden of
  7  5 proof shall be upon any complainant attacking such valuation as
  7  6 excessive, inadequate, inequitable, or capricious. However,
  7  7 in protest or appeal proceedings when the complainant offers
  7  8 competent evidence that the market value of the property is
  7  9 different than the market value determined by the assessor,
  7 10 the burden of proof thereafter shall be upon the officials or
  7 11 persons seeking to uphold such valuation to be assessed.
  7 12    The bill provides that for assessment years beginning on
  7 13 or after January 1, 2019, when a valuation is attacked by a
  7 14 complainant, the burden of proof shall be upon the office of
  7 15 assessor to demonstrate that such valuation is not excessive,
  7 16 inadequate, inequitable, or capricious.
  7 17    Under current law generally, each party to a property tax
  7 18 appeal is responsible for the costs of the appeal incurred
  7 19 by that party.  The bill provides that if the amount of a
  7 20 property's assessment following disposition of all protests
  7 21 or appeals for an assessment year is less than the amount of
  7 22 the assessment specified on the assessment roll, the office of
  7 23 assessor shall reimburse a percentage of the property owner's
  7 24 or aggrieved taxpayer's reasonable costs incurred in all such
  7 25 protests or appeals, excluding those costs apportioned to the
  7 26 board of review or a taxing body pursuant to Code section
  7 27 441.40, if any, equal to the percentage by which the assessment
  7 28 is reduced.  The reimbursement amounts required under the
  7 29 bill are paid from the assessment expense fund under Code
  7 30 section 441.16. However, the bill's requirement to reimburse
  7 31 a percentage of a property owner's or aggrieved taxpayer's
  7 32 reasonable costs shall not apply to costs incurred by the
  7 33 property owner or aggrieved taxpayer for the first assessment
  7 34 year beginning on or after January 1, 2019, for which the owner
  7 35 or taxpayer protests or appeals the assessment of the property
  8  1 and a reduction in the assessment occurs.
  8  2    Current Code section 441.41 authorizes the conference board
  8  3 to employ special counsel to assist the city legal department
  8  4 or the county attorney in litigation dealing with assessments.
  8  5 The bill provides that such authority is subject to review and
  8  6 approval by the city legal department or the county attorney,
  8  7 as applicable, and includes situations where the city legal
  8  8 department or county attorney is disqualified because of a
  8  9 conflict of interest.

  5 33                           EXPLANATION
  5 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  1 This bill relates to property taxation by modifying
  6  2 provisions relating to assessment and exemption of certain
  6  3 property, modifying provisions relating to property assessment
  6  4 appeals, and providing for the reimbursement of certain appeal
  6  5 costs.
  6  6    Current law provides an exemption from property taxation
  6  7 for dwelling unit property owned and managed by a nonprofit
  6  8 community housing development organization if the organization
  6  9 owns and manages more than 150 dwelling units located in a city
  6 10 with a population of more than 110,000. The bill authorizes a
  6 11 similar property tax exemption for assessment years beginning
  6 12 on or after January 1, 2019, for dwelling unit property that
  6 13 is constructed or substantially rehabilitated on or after July
  6 14 1, 2018, if the property is owned, managed, or controlled
  6 15 by a community housing development organization that owns
  6 16 and manages more than 150 dwelling units. The exemption
  6 17 established in the bill does not include a city population
  6 18 requirement and provides that the exemption is allowed for
  6 19 each eligible property unless specifically disapproved by the
  6 20 city if located in a city or the county if located in the
  6 21 unincorporated area of a county.
  6 22    The bill modifies provisions relating to even=numbered
  6 23 assessment years by providing that the assessor shall value
  6 24 and assess or revalue and reassess, as the case may require,
  6 25 any individual real estate parcel that the assessor finds was
  6 26 assessed for more than the value authorized by law or was not
  6 27 listed in the assessment year immediately preceding, and any
  6 28 real estate the assessor finds has changed in value subsequent
  6 29 to January 1 of the preceding real estate assessment year
  6 30 based on buildings erected, improvements made, or buildings or
  6 31 improvements removed in a year after the assessment. The bill
  6 32 also provides that a percentage increase for an even=numbered
  6 33 assessment year shall be applied to all property within the
  6 34 class and shall not be applied only to a subset of the class
  6 35 unless approved by the department of revenue.
  7  1 Current Code section 441.21(3) specifies a burden of proof
  7  2 for taxpayer protests or appeals of property assessments made
  7  3 by local assessors.  The current standard for assessment years
  7  4 beginning on or after January 1, 2018, is that the burden of
  7  5 proof shall be upon any complainant attacking such valuation as
  7  6 excessive, inadequate, inequitable, or capricious. However,
  7  7 in protest or appeal proceedings when the complainant offers
  7  8 competent evidence that the market value of the property is
  7  9 different than the market value determined by the assessor,
  7 10 the burden of proof thereafter shall be upon the officials or
  7 11 persons seeking to uphold such valuation to be assessed.
  7 12    The bill provides that for assessment years beginning on
  7 13 or after January 1, 2019, when a valuation is attacked by a
  7 14 complainant, the burden of proof shall be upon the office of
  7 15 assessor to demonstrate that such valuation is not excessive,
  7 16 inadequate, inequitable, or capricious.
  7 17    Under current law generally, each party to a property tax
  7 18 appeal is responsible for the costs of the appeal incurred
  7 19 by that party.  The bill provides that if the amount of a
  7 20 property's assessment following disposition of all protests
  7 21 or appeals for an assessment year is less than the amount of
  7 22 the assessment specified on the assessment roll, the office of
  7 23 assessor shall reimburse a percentage of the property owner's
  7 24 or aggrieved taxpayer's reasonable costs incurred in all such
  7 25 protests or appeals, excluding those costs apportioned to the
  7 26 board of review or a taxing body pursuant to Code section
  7 27 441.40, if any, equal to the percentage by which the assessment
  7 28 is reduced.  The reimbursement amounts required under the
  7 29 bill are paid from the assessment expense fund under Code
  7 30 section 441.16. However, the bill's requirement to reimburse
  7 31 a percentage of a property owner's or aggrieved taxpayer's
  7 32 reasonable costs shall not apply to costs incurred by the
  7 33 property owner or aggrieved taxpayer for the first assessment
  7 34 year beginning on or after January 1, 2019, for which the owner
  7 35 or taxpayer protests or appeals the assessment of the property
  8  1 and a reduction in the assessment occurs.
  8  2    Current Code section 441.41 authorizes the conference board
  8  3 to employ special counsel to assist the city legal department
  8  4 or the county attorney in litigation dealing with assessments.
  8  5 The bill provides that such authority is subject to review and
  8  6 approval by the city legal department or the county attorney,
  8  7 as applicable, and includes situations where the city legal
  8  8 department or county attorney is disqualified because of a
  8  9 conflict of interest.
  8 10    The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.7 to the
  8 11 section of the bill amending Code section 427.1(21A).  Code
  8 12 section 25B.7 provides that for a property tax credit or
  8 13 exemption enacted on or after January 1, 1997, if a state
  8 14 appropriation made to fund the credit or exemption is not
  8 15 sufficient to fully fund the credit or exemption, the political
  8 16 subdivision shall be required to extend to the taxpayer only
  8 17 that portion of the credit or exemption estimated by the
  8 18 department of revenue to be funded by the state appropriation.

  6 29 to January 1 of the preceding real estate assessment year
  6 30 based on buildings erected, improvements made, or buildings or
  6 31 improvements removed in a year after the assessment. The bill
  6 32 also provides that a percentage increase for an even=numbered

  7  1 Current Code section 441.21(3) specifies a burden of proof
  7  2 for taxpayer protests or appeals of property assessments made
  7  3 by local assessors.  The current standard for assessment years
  7  4 beginning on or after January 1, 2018, is that the burden of
  7  5 proof shall be upon any complainant attacking such valuation as
  7  6 excessive, inadequate, inequitable, or capricious. However,
  7  7 in protest or appeal proceedings when the complainant offers
  7  8 competent evidence that the market value of the property is
  7  9 different than the market value determined by the assessor,
  7 10 the burden of proof thereafter shall be upon the officials or
  7 11 persons seeking to uphold such valuation to be assessed.
  7 12    The bill provides that for assessment years beginning on
  7 13 or after January 1, 2019, when a valuation is attacked by a
  7 14 complainant, the burden of proof shall be upon the office of
  7 15 assessor to demonstrate that such valuation is not excessive,
  7 16 inadequate, inequitable, or capricious.
  7 17    Under current law generally, each party to a property tax
  7 18 appeal is responsible for the costs of the appeal incurred
  7 19 by that party.  The bill provides that if the amount of a
  7 20 property's assessment following disposition of all protests
  7 21 or appeals for an assessment year is less than the amount of
  7 22 the assessment specified on the assessment roll, the office of

  7 24 or aggrieved taxpayer's reasonable costs incurred in all such
  7 25 protests or appeals, excluding those costs apportioned to the
  7 26 board of review or a taxing body pursuant to Code section
  7 27 441.40, if any, equal to the percentage by which the assessment
  7 28 is reduced.  The reimbursement amounts required under the
  7 29 bill are paid from the assessment expense fund under Code
  7 30 section 441.16. However, the bill's requirement to reimburse
  7 31 a percentage of a property owner's or aggrieved taxpayer's
  7 32 reasonable costs shall not apply to costs incurred by the
  7 33 property owner or aggrieved taxpayer for the first assessment
  7 34 year beginning on or after January 1, 2019, for which the owner
  7 35 or taxpayer protests or appeals the assessment of the property

  8 14 appropriation made to fund the credit or exemption is not
  8 15 sufficient to fully fund the credit or exemption, the political

  7 28 is reduced.  The reimbursement amounts required under the

  7 31 a percentage of a property owner's or aggrieved taxpayer's

  7  1 Current Code section 441.21(3) specifies a burden of proof
  7  2 for taxpayer protests or appeals of property assessments made

  7  4 beginning on or after January 1, 2018, is that the burden of
  7  5 proof shall be upon any complainant attacking such valuation as
  7  6 excessive, inadequate, inequitable, or capricious. However,
  7  7 in protest or appeal proceedings when the complainant offers
  7  8 competent evidence that the market value of the property is
  7  9 different than the market value determined by the assessor,
  7 10 the burden of proof thereafter shall be upon the officials or
  7 11 persons seeking to uphold such valuation to be assessed.
  7 12    The bill provides that for assessment years beginning on
  7 13 or after January 1, 2019, when a valuation is attacked by a
  7 14 complainant, the burden of proof shall be upon the office of
  7 15 assessor to demonstrate that such valuation is not excessive,
  7 16 inadequate, inequitable, or capricious.
  7 17    Under current law generally, each party to a property tax
  7 18 appeal is responsible for the costs of the appeal incurred

  7 21 or appeals for an assessment year is less than the amount of
  7 22 the assessment specified on the assessment roll, the office of
  7 23 assessor shall reimburse a percentage of the property owner's
  7 24 or aggrieved taxpayer's reasonable costs incurred in all such
  7 25 protests or appeals, excluding those costs apportioned to the
  7 26 board of review or a taxing body pursuant to Code section
  7 27 441.40, if any, equal to the percentage by which the assessment
  7 28 is reduced.  The reimbursement amounts required under the
  7 29 bill are paid from the assessment expense fund under Code
  7 30 section 441.16. However, the bill's requirement to reimburse
  7 31 a percentage of a property owner's or aggrieved taxpayer's
  7 32 reasonable costs shall not apply to costs incurred by the
  7 33 property owner or aggrieved taxpayer for the first assessment
  7 34 year beginning on or after January 1, 2019, for which the owner
  7 35 or taxpayer protests or appeals the assessment of the property

  8 14 appropriation made to fund the credit or exemption is not
  8 15 sufficient to fully fund the credit or exemption, the political
  8 16 subdivision shall be required to extend to the taxpayer only
