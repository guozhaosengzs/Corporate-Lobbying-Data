  6 32    BILL'S PROVISIONS ==== GENERAL.  This bill amends the "Animal
  6 33 Agriculture Compliance Act" (Code chapter 459) which part
  6 34 provides for the regulation of animal feeding operations where
  6 35 agricultural animals are maintained for at least 45 days in
  7  1 any 12=month period and includes open feedlots and confinement
  7  2 feeding operations (operations) including associated
  7  3 confinement feeding operation structures (structures), such
  7  4 as buildings or manure storage structures. The Code chapter
  7  5 is administered and enforced by the department of natural
  7  6 resources (DNR).  Generally, regulations vary based on the size
  7  7 of an operation measured by its animal unit capacity (AUC).
  7  8    BILL'S PROVISIONS ==== RELATED CONFINEMENT FEEDING OPERATIONS.
  7  9  The bill provides that for purposes of administering and
  7 10 enforcing Code chapter 459, subchapter II, providing for air
  7 11 quality regulations and Code chapter 459, subchapter III,
  7 12 providing for water quality regulations, two or more operations
  7 13 are deemed to be a single operation if they are related.  The
  7 14 operations are related if a structure that is part of one
  7 15 operation is separated by less than 2,500 feet from a structure
  7 16 that is part of the other operation and the same person holds
  7 17 a legal or equitable interest in the real property where the
  7 18 operations are located.  If the person is a business entity,
  7 19 the business entity's interest is attributable to any person
  7 20 who owns an interest in the entity or who is an employee,
  7 21 manager, or officer of the entity.  A person's interest is also
  7 22 attributable to a relative (e.g., spouse, child, or brother or
  7 23 sister).  A person's interest does not include the acquisition
  7 24 of property by a number of devices including by operation of
  7 25 law, an encumbrance taken as a security, or under contract with
  7 26 a government entity.
  7 27    BACKGROUND ==== CURRENT LAW ==== ADJACENCY.  For purposes of air
  7 28 quality regulation, two or more animal feeding operations under
  7 29 common ownership or management are deemed to be a single animal
  7 30 feeding operation if they are adjacent or utilize a common
  7 31 system for manure storage and are separated within a minimum
  7 32 distance from each other based on the size of the operation.
  7 33 For purposes of water quality regulation, two or more animal
  7 34 feeding operations under common ownership or management are
  7 35 deemed to be a single operation if they are adjacent or utilize
  8  1 a common area or system for manure disposal and are separated
  8  2 by another set of separation distances again based on the size
  8  3 of the operation.
  8  4    BACKGROUND == AUC.  AUC  refers to a measurement used to
  8  5 determine the maximum number of animal units that may be
  8  6 maintained as part of an animal feeding operation at any one
  8  7 time.  In calculating AUC, a special equivalency factor is
  8  8 assigned for each classification of confined animal.
  8  9    BACKGROUND ==== ENFORCEMENT AND APPLICABLE CIVIL PENALTIES.
  8 10  Compliance with a statutory regulation under the Code chapter
  8 11 includes compliance with a rule adopted by DNR (Code section
  8 12 459.103). Code section 459.602 provides for civil penalties
  8 13 that may be assessed for violations of Code chapter 459,
  8 14 subchapter II (air quality regulations). A violator is subject
  8 15 to Code section 455B.109, which provides for the administrative
  8 16 assessment of civil penalties of up to $10,000. Code section
  8 17 459.603 provides for civil penalties that may be assessed for
  8 18 violations of Code chapter 459, subchapter III (water quality
  8 19 regulations).  A violator is subject to either Code section
  8 20 455B.109 providing for the administrative assessment of civil

  8 22 general civil penalty assessed judicially of up to $5,000.

  7 27    BACKGROUND ==== CURRENT LAW ==== ADJACENCY.  For purposes of air
  7 28 quality regulation, two or more animal feeding operations under
  7 29 common ownership or management are deemed to be a single animal
  7 30 feeding operation if they are adjacent or utilize a common
  7 31 system for manure storage and are separated within a minimum
  7 32 distance from each other based on the size of the operation.
  7 33 For purposes of water quality regulation, two or more animal
  7 34 feeding operations under common ownership or management are
  7 35 deemed to be a single operation if they are adjacent or utilize
  8  1 a common area or system for manure disposal and are separated
  8  2 by another set of separation distances again based on the size
  8  3 of the operation.
  8  4    BACKGROUND == AUC.  AUC  refers to a measurement used to
  8  5 determine the maximum number of animal units that may be
  8  6 maintained as part of an animal feeding operation at any one
  8  7 time.  In calculating AUC, a special equivalency factor is
  8  8 assigned for each classification of confined animal.

  8 10  Compliance with a statutory regulation under the Code chapter
  8 11 includes compliance with a rule adopted by DNR (Code section
  8 12 459.103). Code section 459.602 provides for civil penalties
  8 13 that may be assessed for violations of Code chapter 459,
  8 14 subchapter II (air quality regulations). A violator is subject
  8 15 to Code section 455B.109, which provides for the administrative
  8 16 assessment of civil penalties of up to $10,000. Code section
  8 17 459.603 provides for civil penalties that may be assessed for

  7 10 enforcing Code chapter 459, subchapter II, providing for air
  7 11 quality regulations and Code chapter 459, subchapter III,
  7 12 providing for water quality regulations, two or more operations
  7 13 are deemed to be a single operation if they are related.  The
  7 14 operations are related if a structure that is part of one
  7 15 operation is separated by less than 2,500 feet from a structure
  7 16 that is part of the other operation and the same person holds
  7 17 a legal or equitable interest in the real property where the
  7 18 operations are located.  If the person is a business entity,
  7 19 the business entity's interest is attributable to any person
  7 20 who owns an interest in the entity or who is an employee,
  7 21 manager, or officer of the entity.  A person's interest is also
  7 22 attributable to a relative (e.g., spouse, child, or brother or
  7 23 sister).  A person's interest does not include the acquisition
  7 24 of property by a number of devices including by operation of
  7 25 law, an encumbrance taken as a security, or under contract with
  7 26 a government entity.
  7 27    BACKGROUND ==== CURRENT LAW ==== ADJACENCY.  For purposes of air
  7 28 quality regulation, two or more animal feeding operations under
  7 29 common ownership or management are deemed to be a single animal
  7 30 feeding operation if they are adjacent or utilize a common
  7 31 system for manure storage and are separated within a minimum
  7 32 distance from each other based on the size of the operation.
  7 33 For purposes of water quality regulation, two or more animal
  7 34 feeding operations under common ownership or management are
  7 35 deemed to be a single operation if they are adjacent or utilize
  8  1 a common area or system for manure disposal and are separated
  8  2 by another set of separation distances again based on the size
  8  3 of the operation.
  8  4    BACKGROUND == AUC.  AUC  refers to a measurement used to
  8  5 determine the maximum number of animal units that may be
  8  6 maintained as part of an animal feeding operation at any one
  8  7 time.  In calculating AUC, a special equivalency factor is
  8  8 assigned for each classification of confined animal.
  8  9    BACKGROUND ==== ENFORCEMENT AND APPLICABLE CIVIL PENALTIES.
  8 10  Compliance with a statutory regulation under the Code chapter
  8 11 includes compliance with a rule adopted by DNR (Code section
  8 12 459.103). Code section 459.602 provides for civil penalties
  8 13 that may be assessed for violations of Code chapter 459,
  8 14 subchapter II (air quality regulations). A violator is subject
  8 15 to Code section 455B.109, which provides for the administrative
  8 16 assessment of civil penalties of up to $10,000. Code section
  8 17 459.603 provides for civil penalties that may be assessed for
  8 18 violations of Code chapter 459, subchapter III (water quality
  8 19 regulations).  A violator is subject to either Code section
  8 20 455B.109 providing for the administrative assessment of civil
  8 21 penalties or Code section 455B.191, which provides for a
  8 22 general civil penalty assessed judicially of up to $5,000.
