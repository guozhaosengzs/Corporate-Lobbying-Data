  2 35                           EXPLANATION
  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill modifies certain criminal acts that involve
  3  4 payment cards.
  3  5    Current Code section 715A.10 prohibits a person from
  3  6 using a scanning device to access information encoded on
  3  7 the magnetic strip or stripe of a payment card without the
  3  8 permission of the authorized user of the payment card, and with
  3  9 the intent to defraud the authorized user, the issuer of the
  3 10 authorized user's payment card, or a merchant. A person is
  3 11 also prohibited from using a reencoder to place information
  3 12 encoded on the magnetic strip or stripe of a payment card
  3 13 onto the magnetic strip or stripe of another card without the
  3 14 permission of the authorized user of the card from which the
  3 15 information is being reencoded, and with the intent to defraud
  3 16 the authorized user, the issuer of the authorized user's
  3 17 payment card, or a merchant.
  3 18    The bill makes several changes to terminology in Code
  3 19 section 715A.10. The bill replaces the term "reencoder" with
  3 20 "encoding machine", defined as an electronic device that is
  3 21 used to encode information onto a payment card. The bill
  3 22 expands the definition of "merchant" to include an establishing
  3 23 financial institution as referred to in Code section 527.5.
  3 24 The bill expands the definition of "payment card" to include
  3 25 an access device as defined in Code section 527.2. The
  3 26 bill expands the definition of "scanning device" to include
  3 27 a wireless access device, radio frequency identification
  3 28 scanner, and an electronic device that utilizes near=field
  3 29 communications technology. The bill removes any references to
  3 30 the magnetic strip or stripes of payment cards in Code section
  3 31 715A.10.
  3 32    The bill broadens the prohibitions against using a scanning
  3 33 device or encoding machine to commit fraud by prohibiting the
  3 34 direct or indirect use of such a device or machine. The bill
  3 35 also removes the requirement that a person have intent to
  4  1 defraud for the prohibitions against using a scanning device or
  4  2 encoding machine to commit fraud.
  4  3    The bill makes it a criminal act to possess a scanning
  4  4 device with the intent to use such device to obtain information
  4  5 encoded on a payment card without permission from the
  4  6 authorized user of the payment card, the issuer of such card,
  4  7 or a merchant, or to possess a scanning device with knowledge
  4  8 that another person intends to use the device to obtain
  4  9 information encoded on a payment card without permission from
  4 10 the authorized user of the payment card, the issuer of such
  4 11 card, or a merchant.
  4 12    A person who commits a violation of Code section 715A.10
  4 13 commits a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable
  4 14 by confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at
  4 15 least $750 but not more than $7,500. A second or subsequent
  4 16 violation of Code section 715A.10 is a class "C" felony. A
  4 17 class "C" felony is punishable by confinement for no more
  4 18 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
  4 19 $10,000.
  4 20    Current law defines "criminal mischief" as the intentional
  4 21 damage, defacement, alteration, or destruction of property
  4 22 by a person who has no right to do so. The bill provides
  4 23 that a person commits criminal mischief in the third degree
  4 24 if the act is committed upon real or personal property that
  4 25 has the ability to process a payment card as defined in Code
  4 26 section 715A.10. Criminal mischief in the third degree is
  4 27 an aggravated misdemeanor. An aggravated misdemeanor is
  4 28 punishable by confinement for no more than two years and a fine
  4 29 of at least $625 but not more than $6,250.

  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill modifies certain criminal acts that involve
  3  4 payment cards.
  3  5    Current Code section 715A.10 prohibits a person from
  3  6 using a scanning device to access information encoded on
  3  7 the magnetic strip or stripe of a payment card without the
  3  8 permission of the authorized user of the payment card, and with
  3  9 the intent to defraud the authorized user, the issuer of the
  3 10 authorized user's payment card, or a merchant. A person is
  3 11 also prohibited from using a reencoder to place information
  3 12 encoded on the magnetic strip or stripe of a payment card
  3 13 onto the magnetic strip or stripe of another card without the
  3 14 permission of the authorized user of the card from which the
  3 15 information is being reencoded, and with the intent to defraud
  3 16 the authorized user, the issuer of the authorized user's
  3 17 payment card, or a merchant.
  3 18    The bill makes several changes to terminology in Code
  3 19 section 715A.10. The bill replaces the term "reencoder" with
  3 20 "encoding machine", defined as an electronic device that is
  3 21 used to encode information onto a payment card. The bill
  3 22 expands the definition of "merchant" to include an establishing
  3 23 financial institution as referred to in Code section 527.5.
  3 24 The bill expands the definition of "payment card" to include
  3 25 an access device as defined in Code section 527.2. The
  3 26 bill expands the definition of "scanning device" to include
  3 27 a wireless access device, radio frequency identification
  3 28 scanner, and an electronic device that utilizes near=field
  3 29 communications technology. The bill removes any references to
  3 30 the magnetic strip or stripes of payment cards in Code section
  3 31 715A.10.
  3 32    The bill broadens the prohibitions against using a scanning
  3 33 device or encoding machine to commit fraud by prohibiting the
  3 34 direct or indirect use of such a device or machine. The bill
  3 35 also removes the requirement that a person have intent to
  4  1 defraud for the prohibitions against using a scanning device or
  4  2 encoding machine to commit fraud.
  4  3    The bill makes it a criminal act to possess a scanning
  4  4 device with the intent to use such device to obtain information
  4  5 encoded on a payment card without permission from the
  4  6 authorized user of the payment card, the issuer of such card,
  4  7 or a merchant, or to possess a scanning device with knowledge
  4  8 that another person intends to use the device to obtain
  4  9 information encoded on a payment card without permission from
  4 10 the authorized user of the payment card, the issuer of such
  4 11 card, or a merchant.
  4 12    A person who commits a violation of Code section 715A.10
  4 13 commits a class "D" felony. A class "D" felony is punishable
  4 14 by confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at
  4 15 least $750 but not more than $7,500. A second or subsequent
  4 16 violation of Code section 715A.10 is a class "C" felony. A
  4 17 class "C" felony is punishable by confinement for no more
  4 18 than 10 years and a fine of at least $1,000 but not more than
  4 19 $10,000.
  4 20    Current law defines "criminal mischief" as the intentional
  4 21 damage, defacement, alteration, or destruction of property
  4 22 by a person who has no right to do so. The bill provides
  4 23 that a person commits criminal mischief in the third degree
  4 24 if the act is committed upon real or personal property that
  4 25 has the ability to process a payment card as defined in Code
  4 26 section 715A.10. Criminal mischief in the third degree is
  4 27 an aggravated misdemeanor. An aggravated misdemeanor is
  4 28 punishable by confinement for no more than two years and a fine
  4 29 of at least $625 but not more than $6,250.
