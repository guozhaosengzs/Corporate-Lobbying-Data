  1  1    Section 1.  MEDICAID MANAGED CARE OVERSIGHT AND
  1  2 IMPROVEMENT.  The department of human services shall adopt
  1  3 rules pursuant to chapter 17A and shall amend all Medicaid
  1  4 managed care contracts to provide for all of the following:
  1  5    1.  TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING
  1  6 ERRORS.
  1  7    a.  A managed care organization shall provide documentation
  1  8 to a Medicaid provider claimant when the managed care
  1  9 organization contests or denies a claim, in whole or in part,
  1 10 within fifteen calendar days after receipt of the claim.  The
  1 11 documentation shall, with as much specificity as possible,
  1 12 identify the claim or portion of the claim affected, and shall
  1 13 provide an explanation including the reasons for contesting
  1 14 or denying the claim utilizing the federal Health Insurance
  1 15 Portability and Accountability Act standard claim adjustment
  1 16 reason codes and remittance advice remark codes, or other
  1 17 standard adjustment reasons and remark codes approved by rule
  1 18 of the department. A managed care organization shall utilize
  1 19 the standard coding and format of responses, established
  1 20 uniformly across all managed care organizations, as required by
  1 21 rule of the department.
  1 22    b.  When a Medicaid provider, a managed care organization, or
  1 23 another affected entity identifies a systemic programming or
  1 24 processing error in a managed care organization's programming
  1 25 or processing system that results in systemic incorrect
  1 26 results, including those related to Medicaid provider payment
  1 27 or authorizations, the managed care organization shall correct
  1 28 the programming or processing error within thirty calendar days
  1 29 of the discovery of the error and shall reprocess any affected
  1 30 payments or authorizations with sixty calendar days of the
  1 31 discovery of such error.
  1 32    c.  A managed care organization that fails to pay, deny, or
  1 33 settle a clean claim in full within the time frame established
  1 34 by the managed care contract shall pay the Medicaid provider
  1 35 claimant interest equal to twelve percent per annum on the
  2  1 total amount of the claim ultimately authorized.
  2  2    d.  For claims ultimately found to be incorrectly denied
  2  3 or underpaid through an appeals process or audit, a managed
  2  4 care organization shall pay a Medicaid provider claimant, in
  2  5 addition to the amount determined to be owed, interest of
  2  6 twenty percent per annum on the total amount of the claim as
  2  7 calculated from fifteen calendar days after the date the claim
  2  8 was submitted.
  2  9    e.  If a managed care organization disputes a portion of a
  2 10 claim, any undisputed portion of the claim is deemed a clean
  2 11 claim and shall be paid within the time frame for the payment
  2 12 of clean claims established by the managed care contract such
  2 13 that ninety percent of clean claims are paid or denied within
  2 14 fourteen calendar days of receipt, ninety=nine and one=half
  2 15 percent of clean claims are paid or denied within twenty=one
  2 16 calendar days of receipt, and one hundred percent of clean
  2 17 claims are paid or denied within ninety calendar days of
  2 18 receipt.
  2 19    2.  SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND RATE CHANGES.
  2 20    a.  A managed care organization shall pay interest of twelve
  2 21 percent per annum on any physician supplemental payment or
  2 22 graduated medical education payment paid after the fifteenth
  2 23 day of the month in which the payment is due.
  2 24    b.  Retroactive rate decreases such as rebasing delays,
  2 25 update delays, cost containment, or other payment changes and
  2 26 delays shall not be retroactively applicable to a date that
  2 27 is more than three months from the date of the final rate
  2 28 decision.
  2 29    3.  APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.
  2 30    a.  (1)  The department shall establish an appeals and
  2 31 external review process for Medicaid members and Medicaid
  2 32 providers for review of adverse determinations issued by a
  2 33 managed care organization.
  2 34    (2)  The process shall require that an internal appeal to a
  2 35 managed care organization of an adverse determination resulting
  3  1 from a first=level review be completed and a notice of the
  3  2 decision issued by a managed care organization within fifteen
  3  3 calendar days of a request by a Medicaid member or Medicaid
  3  4 provider for an internal appeal or within three calendar days
  3  5 if the appeal is considered expedited based on urgent medical
  3  6 need.
  3  7    (3)  If an internal appeal results in a final adverse
  3  8 determination, the Medicaid member or Medicaid provider may
  3  9 either appeal the decision as a contested case pursuant to
  3 10 chapter 17A, or may request an external review.
  3 11    (4)  The department shall establish an external review and
  3 12 an expedited external review process, consistent with chapter
  3 13 514J, to the extent applicable. The process shall allow a

  3 17 from a managed care organization.  If an external review or
  3 18 expedited external review is approved by the department, the
  3 19 review shall be completed and a decision shall be issued by
  3 20 the independent review organization within forty=five calendar
  3 21 days of receipt of the request for external review and within
  3 22 seventy=two hours of receipt of the request for an expedited

  3 25 review.
  3 26    (5)  The department shall enter into a contract with
  3 27 an independent review organization that does not have a
  3 28 conflict of interest with the department or any managed care
  3 29 organization to conduct the external reviews.
  3 30    b.  A managed care organization shall allow a Medicaid
  3 31 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  3 32 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  3 33 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  3 34 or payment claims affected, in a request for an internal
  3 35 managed care organization review or appeal.
  4  1    c.  The department shall enter into a contract with an
  4  2 independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at least
  4  3 once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims paid
  4  4 and denied by a managed care organization.  Each managed care
  4  5 organization and each managed care organization's subcontractor
  4  6 shall pay any claim that the independent auditor determines to
  4  7 be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and
  4  8 any costs attributable to the annual audit.  The independent
  4  9 auditor shall also review payment patterns to determine any
  4 10 unfair payment patterns and shall review any request for such
  4 11 investigation based on submission of evidence by a Medicaid
  4 12 provider of an unfair payment practice in accordance with
  4 13 standards developed by the department.
  4 14    d.  If a claim submitted to a managed care organization is
  4 15 not deemed a clean claim and remains in dispute for longer than
  4 16 six months from the date initially submitted, the claim shall
  4 17 automatically be subject to the appeals and external review
  4 18 process established by the department.
  4 19    4.  LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.
  4 20    a.  A managed care organization shall provide and maintain
  4 21 an internet site available to all Medicaid providers under
  4 22 contract with the managed care organization to request

  4 24 and submit, process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims
  4 25 electronically.
  4 26    b.  The department shall develop and require all managed care
  4 27 organizations to utilize, a standardized enrollment form and a
  4 28 uniform process for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid
  4 29 providers.
  4 30    c.  Upon request by a Medicaid provider, the department
  4 31 shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data to a
  4 32 Medicaid provider under contract with a specified managed care
  4 33 organization within sixty calendar days of the request. The
  4 34 provision of the patient encounter data shall comply with the
  4 35 federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
  5  1 and any other applicable federal and state laws and regulatory
  5  2 requirements and shall include but not be limited to the
  5  3 managed care organization's claim number, the Medicaid member
  5  4 identification number, the Medicaid member's name, the type of
  5  5 claim, the amount billed by revenue code and procedure code,
  5  6 the managed care organization's paid amount and payment date,
  5  7 and the hospital patient account number, as applicable.  The
  5  8 department may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of

  5 18 Medicaid provider shall be provided two business days from the
  5 19 date of denial to request reconsideration of the authorization.
  5 20 Following a reconsideration, if the authorization is denied,
  5 21 the reconsideration shall be subject to peer=to=peer review.
  5 22    c.  The department shall establish a fee schedule,
  5 23 proportionate to the lost productivity of staff and resources
  5 24 experienced by a Medicaid provider, that results from the
  5 25 completion of the prior authorization process.
  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90

  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  5 22    c.  The department shall establish a fee schedule,
  5 23 proportionate to the lost productivity of staff and resources
  5 24 experienced by a Medicaid provider, that results from the
  5 25 completion of the prior authorization process.
  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90
  6 22 calendar days of receipt.
  6 23    SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND RATE CHANGES.  The bill requires
  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  1 21 rule of the department.
  1 22    b.  When a Medicaid provider, a managed care organization, or
  1 23 another affected entity identifies a systemic programming or
  1 24 processing error in a managed care organization's programming
  1 25 or processing system that results in systemic incorrect
  1 26 results, including those related to Medicaid provider payment
  1 27 or authorizations, the managed care organization shall correct
  1 28 the programming or processing error within thirty calendar days
  1 29 of the discovery of the error and shall reprocess any affected
  1 30 payments or authorizations with sixty calendar days of the
  1 31 discovery of such error.
  1 32    c.  A managed care organization that fails to pay, deny, or

  1 34 by the managed care contract shall pay the Medicaid provider
  1 35 claimant interest equal to twelve percent per annum on the
  2  1 total amount of the claim ultimately authorized.
  2  2    d.  For claims ultimately found to be incorrectly denied
  2  3 or underpaid through an appeals process or audit, a managed
  2  4 care organization shall pay a Medicaid provider claimant, in
  2  5 addition to the amount determined to be owed, interest of
  2  6 twenty percent per annum on the total amount of the claim as
  2  7 calculated from fifteen calendar days after the date the claim
  2  8 was submitted.
  2  9    e.  If a managed care organization disputes a portion of a
  2 10 claim, any undisputed portion of the claim is deemed a clean
  2 11 claim and shall be paid within the time frame for the payment
  2 12 of clean claims established by the managed care contract such
  2 13 that ninety percent of clean claims are paid or denied within
  2 14 fourteen calendar days of receipt, ninety=nine and one=half
  2 15 percent of clean claims are paid or denied within twenty=one
  2 16 calendar days of receipt, and one hundred percent of clean
  2 17 claims are paid or denied within ninety calendar days of
  2 18 receipt.
  2 19    2.  SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND RATE CHANGES.

  2 21 percent per annum on any physician supplemental payment or
  2 22 graduated medical education payment paid after the fifteenth
  2 23 day of the month in which the payment is due.
  2 24    b.  Retroactive rate decreases such as rebasing delays,
  2 25 update delays, cost containment, or other payment changes and
  2 26 delays shall not be retroactively applicable to a date that
  2 27 is more than three months from the date of the final rate
  2 28 decision.
  2 29    3.  APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.
  2 30    a.  (1)  The department shall establish an appeals and

  3  4 provider for an internal appeal or within three calendar days
  3  5 if the appeal is considered expedited based on urgent medical
  3  6 need.
  3  7    (3)  If an internal appeal results in a final adverse
  3  8 determination, the Medicaid member or Medicaid provider may
  3  9 either appeal the decision as a contested case pursuant to

  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90

  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  1  6 ERRORS.
  1  7    a.  A managed care organization shall provide documentation
  1  8 to a Medicaid provider claimant when the managed care
  1  9 organization contests or denies a claim, in whole or in part,
  1 10 within fifteen calendar days after receipt of the claim.  The
  1 11 documentation shall, with as much specificity as possible,
  1 12 identify the claim or portion of the claim affected, and shall

  1 21 rule of the department.
  1 22    b.  When a Medicaid provider, a managed care organization, or
  1 23 another affected entity identifies a systemic programming or
  1 24 processing error in a managed care organization's programming
  1 25 or processing system that results in systemic incorrect
  1 26 results, including those related to Medicaid provider payment
  1 27 or authorizations, the managed care organization shall correct
  1 28 the programming or processing error within thirty calendar days
  1 29 of the discovery of the error and shall reprocess any affected
  1 30 payments or authorizations with sixty calendar days of the
  1 31 discovery of such error.
  1 32    c.  A managed care organization that fails to pay, deny, or
  1 33 settle a clean claim in full within the time frame established
  1 34 by the managed care contract shall pay the Medicaid provider
  1 35 claimant interest equal to twelve percent per annum on the
  2  1 total amount of the claim ultimately authorized.
  2  2    d.  For claims ultimately found to be incorrectly denied

  2  4 care organization shall pay a Medicaid provider claimant, in
  2  5 addition to the amount determined to be owed, interest of
  2  6 twenty percent per annum on the total amount of the claim as
  2  7 calculated from fifteen calendar days after the date the claim
  2  8 was submitted.
  2  9    e.  If a managed care organization disputes a portion of a
  2 10 claim, any undisputed portion of the claim is deemed a clean
  2 11 claim and shall be paid within the time frame for the payment
  2 12 of clean claims established by the managed care contract such
  2 13 that ninety percent of clean claims are paid or denied within
  2 14 fourteen calendar days of receipt, ninety=nine and one=half
  2 15 percent of clean claims are paid or denied within twenty=one
  2 16 calendar days of receipt, and one hundred percent of clean

  2 21 percent per annum on any physician supplemental payment or
  2 22 graduated medical education payment paid after the fifteenth
  2 23 day of the month in which the payment is due.
  2 24    b.  Retroactive rate decreases such as rebasing delays,
  2 25 update delays, cost containment, or other payment changes and
  2 26 delays shall not be retroactively applicable to a date that
  2 27 is more than three months from the date of the final rate
  2 28 decision.
  2 29    3.  APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.
  2 30    a.  (1)  The department shall establish an appeals and
  2 31 external review process for Medicaid members and Medicaid
  2 32 providers for review of adverse determinations issued by a

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent

  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  2  7 calculated from fifteen calendar days after the date the claim
  2  8 was submitted.
  2  9    e.  If a managed care organization disputes a portion of a

  2 29    3.  APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.
  2 30    a.  (1)  The department shall establish an appeals and

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill

  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to

  5 21 the reconsideration shall be subject to peer=to=peer review.
  5 22    c.  The department shall establish a fee schedule,

  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90
  6 22 calendar days of receipt.
  6 23    SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND RATE CHANGES.  The bill requires
  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the

  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the

  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the

  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90
  6 22 calendar days of receipt.
  6 23    SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND RATE CHANGES.  The bill requires
  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  2  7 calculated from fifteen calendar days after the date the claim
  2  8 was submitted.
  2  9    e.  If a managed care organization disputes a portion of a
  2 10 claim, any undisputed portion of the claim is deemed a clean
  2 11 claim and shall be paid within the time frame for the payment

  2 25 update delays, cost containment, or other payment changes and
  2 26 delays shall not be retroactively applicable to a date that
  2 27 is more than three months from the date of the final rate
  2 28 decision.
  2 29    3.  APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.
  2 30    a.  (1)  The department shall establish an appeals and

  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill

  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members

  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject

  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the

  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent

  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the

  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90
  6 22 calendar days of receipt.
  6 23    SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND RATE CHANGES.  The bill requires
  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  3  4 provider for an internal appeal or within three calendar days
  3  5 if the appeal is considered expedited based on urgent medical
  3  6 need.
  3  7    (3)  If an internal appeal results in a final adverse

  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at

  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The

  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in

  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all

  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the

  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90
  6 22 calendar days of receipt.
  6 23    SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND RATE CHANGES.  The bill requires
  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  1 26 results, including those related to Medicaid provider payment
  1 27 or authorizations, the managed care organization shall correct
  1 28 the programming or processing error within thirty calendar days
  1 29 of the discovery of the error and shall reprocess any affected
  1 30 payments or authorizations with sixty calendar days of the
  1 31 discovery of such error.

  2  3 or underpaid through an appeals process or audit, a managed
  2  4 care organization shall pay a Medicaid provider claimant, in

  2  6 twenty percent per annum on the total amount of the claim as
  2  7 calculated from fifteen calendar days after the date the claim
  2  8 was submitted.
  2  9    e.  If a managed care organization disputes a portion of a
  2 10 claim, any undisputed portion of the claim is deemed a clean
  2 11 claim and shall be paid within the time frame for the payment
  2 12 of clean claims established by the managed care contract such
  2 13 that ninety percent of clean claims are paid or denied within
  2 14 fourteen calendar days of receipt, ninety=nine and one=half

  3  3 calendar days of a request by a Medicaid member or Medicaid
  3  4 provider for an internal appeal or within three calendar days
  3  5 if the appeal is considered expedited based on urgent medical
  3  6 need.
  3  7    (3)  If an internal appeal results in a final adverse
  3  8 determination, the Medicaid member or Medicaid provider may

  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review

  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required

  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90
  6 22 calendar days of receipt.
  6 23    SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND RATE CHANGES.  The bill requires
  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill

  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at

  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The

  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the

  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of

  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;

  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct

  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90
  6 22 calendar days of receipt.

  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  3 31 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  3 32 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  3 33 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  3 34 or payment claims affected, in a request for an internal

  4 11 investigation based on submission of evidence by a Medicaid
  4 12 provider of an unfair payment practice in accordance with
  4 13 standards developed by the department.
  4 14    d.  If a claim submitted to a managed care organization is
  4 15 not deemed a clean claim and remains in dispute for longer than
  4 16 six months from the date initially submitted, the claim shall
  4 17 automatically be subject to the appeals and external review

  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time

  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at

  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The

  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in

  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90
  6 22 calendar days of receipt.
  6 23    SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND RATE CHANGES.  The bill requires
  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90
  6 22 calendar days of receipt.

  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  4 11 investigation based on submission of evidence by a Medicaid
  4 12 provider of an unfair payment practice in accordance with

  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple

  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in

  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to

  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the

  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior

  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90
  6 22 calendar days of receipt.
  6 23    SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND RATE CHANGES.  The bill requires
  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90
  6 22 calendar days of receipt.
  6 23    SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND RATE CHANGES.  The bill requires
  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  4  7 be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and
  4  8 any costs attributable to the annual audit.  The independent
  4  9 auditor shall also review payment patterns to determine any
  4 10 unfair payment patterns and shall review any request for such
  4 11 investigation based on submission of evidence by a Medicaid
  4 12 provider of an unfair payment practice in accordance with
  4 13 standards developed by the department.
  4 14    d.  If a claim submitted to a managed care organization is
  4 15 not deemed a clean claim and remains in dispute for longer than
  4 16 six months from the date initially submitted, the claim shall

  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the

  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost

  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill

  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the

  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.

  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the

  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90
  6 22 calendar days of receipt.
  6 23    SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND RATE CHANGES.  The bill requires
  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  4  5 organization and each managed care organization's subcontractor
  4  6 shall pay any claim that the independent auditor determines to
  4  7 be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated damages, and
  4  8 any costs attributable to the annual audit.  The independent
  4  9 auditor shall also review payment patterns to determine any
  4 10 unfair payment patterns and shall review any request for such
  4 11 investigation based on submission of evidence by a Medicaid
  4 12 provider of an unfair payment practice in accordance with
  4 13 standards developed by the department.
  4 14    d.  If a claim submitted to a managed care organization is
  4 15 not deemed a clean claim and remains in dispute for longer than
  4 16 six months from the date initially submitted, the claim shall
  4 17 automatically be subject to the appeals and external review
  4 18 process established by the department.
  4 19    4.  LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.

  4 31 shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter data to a
  4 32 Medicaid provider under contract with a specified managed care
  4 33 organization within sixty calendar days of the request. The
  4 34 provision of the patient encounter data shall comply with the
  4 35 federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
  5  1 and any other applicable federal and state laws and regulatory
  5  2 requirements and shall include but not be limited to the

  5  4 identification number, the Medicaid member's name, the type of
  5  5 claim, the amount billed by revenue code and procedure code,
  5  6 the managed care organization's paid amount and payment date,
  5  7 and the hospital patient account number, as applicable.  The
  5  8 department may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost of
  5  9 providing the patient encounter data to Medicaid providers.
  5 10    5.  PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.

  5 23 proportionate to the lost productivity of staff and resources
  5 24 experienced by a Medicaid provider, that results from the

  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent

  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at

  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all

  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the

  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90
  6 22 calendar days of receipt.

  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides

  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent

  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  5 18 Medicaid provider shall be provided two business days from the
  5 19 date of denial to request reconsideration of the authorization.
  5 20 Following a reconsideration, if the authorization is denied,
  5 21 the reconsideration shall be subject to peer=to=peer review.
  5 22    c.  The department shall establish a fee schedule,

  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  5 18 Medicaid provider shall be provided two business days from the
  5 19 date of denial to request reconsideration of the authorization.
  5 20 Following a reconsideration, if the authorization is denied,
  5 21 the reconsideration shall be subject to peer=to=peer review.
  5 22    c.  The department shall establish a fee schedule,
  5 23 proportionate to the lost productivity of staff and resources
  5 24 experienced by a Medicaid provider, that results from the
  5 25 completion of the prior authorization process.

  5 26                           EXPLANATION
  5 27 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90
  6 22 calendar days of receipt.
  6 23    SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AND RATE CHANGES.  The bill requires
  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at

  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  5 28 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 29    This bill relates to Medicaid managed care oversight and
  5 30 improvement.
  5 31    The bill requires the department of human services (DHS) to
  5 32 adopt administrative rules and amend all Medicaid managed care
  5 33 contracts to address timely payment and correction of claims
  5 34 processing errors; supplemental payments and rate changes;
  5 35 appeals external review and audit processes; logistics and
  6  1 documentation; and prior authorization under Medicaid managed
  6  2 care.
  6  3    TIMELY PAYMENT AND CORRECTION OF CLAIMS PROCESSING ERRORS.
  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill

  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent
  6 21 within 21 calendar days of receipt, and 100 percent within 90
  6 22 calendar days of receipt.

  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.

  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  6  4  The bill requires a Medicaid managed care organization (MCO)
  6  5 to provide specific documentation to a Medicaid provider
  6  6 claimant when the MCO contests or denies a claim.  The bill
  6  7 requires that if a systemic programming or processing error in
  6  8 an MCO's programming or processing system is identified that
  6  9 results in systemic incorrect results, the MCO  shall correct
  6 10 the programming or processing error within 30 calendar days
  6 11 and reprocess any affected payments or authorizations within
  6 12 60 calendar days of the discovery of such error. The bill
  6 13 requires the payment of interest on claims that are not paid
  6 14 within certain time frames or that, following appeal or audit,
  6 15 are found to be incorrectly denied or underpaid.   The bill
  6 16 provides that any portion of a claim which is not disputed is
  6 17 deemed a clean claim and is required to be paid by an MCO within
  6 18 the time frame for the payment of clean claims established by
  6 19 an MCO contract such that 90 percent of clean claims are paid
  6 20 or denied within 14 calendar days of receipt, 99.5 percent

  6 24 MCOs to pay interest on any physician supplemental payment
  6 25 or graduated medical education payment paid after the 15th
  6 26 day of the month in which the payment is due, and provides
  6 27 that retroactive rate decreases shall not be retroactively
  6 28 applicable to a date that is more than three months from the
  6 29 date of the final rate decision.
  6 30    APPEALS, EXTERNAL REVIEW, AND AUDIT PROCESSES.  The bill
  6 31 requires DHS to establish an appeals and external review
  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.

  6 32 process for Medicaid members and Medicaid providers for review
  6 33 of adverse determinations issued by an MCO, and provides time
  6 34 frames for the processes.  DHS is required to  enter into a
  6 35 contract with an independent review organization that does not
  7  1 have a conflict of interest with DHS or any MCO to conduct the
  7  2 external reviews.  The bill requires an MCO to allow a Medicaid
  7  3 provider to consolidate complaints or appeals of multiple
  7  4 claims that involve the same or a similar payment or coverage
  7  5 issue, regardless of the number of individual Medicaid members
  7  6 or payment claims affected in a request for internal review
  7  7 or appeal. The bill requires DHS to enter into a contract
  7  8 with an independent auditor for the purpose of reviewing, at
  7  9 least once each calendar year, a random sample of all claims
  7 10 paid and denied.  Each MCO and the subcontractors of any MCO
  7 11 are required to pay any claim that the independent auditor
  7 12 determines to be incorrectly denied, any applicable liquidated
  7 13 damages, and the cost of the annual audits conducted.  The
  7 14 independent auditor is also required to review payment patterns
  7 15 to determine any unfair payment patterns and to review any
  7 16 request for such investigation based on submission of evidence
  7 17 by a Medicaid provider of an unfair payment practice in
  7 18 accordance with standards developed by DHS.  The bill provides
  7 19 that if a claim submitted to an MCO is not deemed a clean claim
  7 20 and remains in dispute for longer than six months from the date
  7 21 initially submitted, the claim shall automatically be subject
  7 22 to the appeals and external review process established by DHS.
  7 23    LOGISTICS AND DOCUMENTATION.  An MCO is required to
  7 24 provide  and maintain an internet site available to all
  7 25 Medicaid providers under contract with that MCO to request
  7 26 reconsiderations, submit provider inquiries, and submit,
  7 27 process, edit, rebill, and adjudicate claims electronically.
  7 28 The bill requires DHS to develop and require all MCOs to
  7 29 utilize a standardized enrollment form and a uniform process
  7 30 for credentialing and recredentialing Medicaid providers.
  7 31 The bill provides that upon request of a Medicaid provider,
  7 32 DHS  shall provide accurate and uniform patient encounter
  7 33 data to the Medicaid provider within 60 calendar days of the
  7 34 request.  DHS may charge a reasonable fee for the actual cost
  7 35 of providing the patient encounter data to providers.
  8  1 PRIOR AUTHORIZATION.  The bill provides that prior
  8  2 authorization shall not be required by an MCO for admission
  8  3 of a Medicaid member to an intensive care unit level of
  8  4 care. Additionally, Medicaid providers are allowed to request
  8  5 authorization for an inpatient hospital admission within
  8  6 certain time frames following the admission of a Medicaid
  8  7 member and are provided a process for review of denials of
  8  8 authorization relative to such admissions.  DHS is required
  8  9 to establish a fee schedule, proportionate to the lost
  8 10 productivity of staff and resources experienced by a Medicaid
  8 11 provider, that results from the completion of the prior
  8 12 authorization process.
