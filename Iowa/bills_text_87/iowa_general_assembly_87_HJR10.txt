 12 depends on insect pollination, 80 percent of which is due to
 13 honeybees; and
 14 WHEREAS, tiny as they are, honeybees play a key role in
 15 Iowa's agroecosystem, with plant pollination performed by
 16 honeybees valued at an estimated $92 million annually; and
 17 WHEREAS, approximately 1,500 Iowa beekeepers manage around
 18 30,000 colonies of honeybees that produce over 3 million pounds
 19 of honey annually; and
 20 WHEREAS, limited field trials in Clarion, Iowa, revealed
 21 crop yield gains of 8 percent in soybean fields with honeybee
 22 hives placed in close proximity; and
