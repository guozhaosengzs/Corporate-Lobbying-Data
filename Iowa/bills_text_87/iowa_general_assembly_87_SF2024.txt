  7 15    This chapter modifies, limits, and supersedes the federal
  7 16 Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15
  7 17 U.S.C. {7001 et seq., but does not modify, limit, or supersede
  7 18 section 101(a) of that Act, 15 U.S.C. {7001(a), or authorize
  7 19 electronic delivery of any of the notices described in section
  7 20 103(b) of that Act, 15 U.S.C. {7003(b).
  7 21    Sec. 18.  IMPLEMENTATION OF ACT.  Section 25B.2, subsection
  7 22 3, shall not apply to this Act.
  7 23                           EXPLANATION
  7 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 26    This bill relates to electronic recordings of custodial
  7 27 interrogations in criminal or juvenile cases.
  7 28    Under the bill, a custodial interrogation at a place of
  7 29 detention, including the giving of any required warning,
  7 30 advice of the rights of the individual being questioned, and
  7 31 the waiver of any rights by the individual, must be recorded
  7 32 electronically in its entirety by both audio and video means if
  7 33 the interrogation relates to any crime or delinquent act.
  7 34    The bill defines "custodial interrogation" to mean
  7 35 questioning or other conduct by a law enforcement officer which
  8  1 is reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from
  8  2 an individual and occurs when reasonable individuals in the
  8  3 same circumstances would consider themselves in custody.
  8  4    The bill defines "place of detention" to mean a fixed
  8  5 location under the control of a law enforcement agency where
  8  6 individuals are questioned about alleged crimes or delinquent
  8  7 acts. The term includes a jail, police or sheriff's station,
  8  8 a law enforcement officer's vehicle, holding cell, and
  8  9 correctional or detention facility.
  8 10    The bill does not require a law enforcement officer to
  8 11 obtain consent or inform the person being interrogated that the
  8 12 interrogation is being electronically recorded.
  8 13    The bill does not apply to a spontaneous statement made
  8 14 outside the course of the custodial interrogation or a
  8 15 statement made in response to a question asked routinely during
  8 16 the processing of the arrest of an individual.
  8 17    The requirements of the bill also do not apply to
  8 18 the following situations: the electronic recording is
  8 19 not reasonably feasible under the circumstances, the
  8 20 individual refuses to participate in the interrogation
  8 21 if the interrogation is being recorded, the interrogation
  8 22 occurs in another jurisdiction in compliance with the other
  8 23 jurisdiction's laws or by federal law enforcement in compliance
  8 24 with federal law, the law enforcement officer has no knowledge
  8 25 of the facts that would lead the officer to reasonably believe
  8 26 that the individual being interrogated committed an act which
  8 27 would require the interrogation to be electronically recorded,
  8 28 the law enforcement officer conducting the interrogation
  8 29 reasonably believes the electronic recording would disclose
  8 30 the identity of a confidential informant or jeopardize the
  8 31 safety of an officer or another individual, or the electronic
  8 32 recording equipment fails.
  8 33    If feasible under the circumstances, the bill requires the
  8 34 reason for not electronically recording an interrogation to be
  8 35 contemporaneously electronically recorded.
  9  1 The bill prohibits a law enforcement officer from
  9  2 encouraging an individual to request an interrogation not be
  9  3 electronically recorded.
  9  4    If the prosecution relies on an exception to not
  9  5 electronically record an interrogation, the bill specifies that
  9  6 the burden is on the prosecution to prove by a preponderance of
  9  7 the evidence that an exception does apply.
  9  8    The bill requires the prosecution to provide written notice
  9  9 to a defendant of the intent to rely upon a statement made in a
  9 10 custodial interrogation which was not electronically recorded
  9 11 within 40 days of arraignment.
  9 12    The bill specifies that the court shall consider the
  9 13 failure to electronically record all or part of a custodial
  9 14 interrogation, unless an exception applies, as a factor in
  9 15 determining whether a statement made during the interrogation
  9 16 is admissible, including whether the statement was voluntarily
  9 17 made.
  9 18    The bill requires each law enforcement agency to establish
  9 19 and enforce procedures to ensure that the electronic recording
  9 20 is identifiable, accessible, and preserved for a period
  9 21 of three years after the date of the limitation for the
  9 22 commencement of a criminal action as set forth in Code chapter
  9 23 802.
  9 24    The bill requires each law enforcement agency to establish
  9 25 rules relating to the following: the manner in which an
  9 26 electronic recording is made including the angle and focus
  9 27 of the camera, supervisory responsibilities, a process
  9 28 that details when noncompliance with procedures occurs, the
  9 29 imposition of administrative sanctions for a failure to comply
  9 30 with the procedures, and a process for monitoring the chain of
  9 31 custody of an electronic recording.
  9 32    The bill does not create a right to require a custodial
  9 33 interrogation to be recorded electronically or require a
  9 34 transcript of an electronically recorded interrogation to be
  9 35 prepared.
 10  1 The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 10  2 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 10  3 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 10  4 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 10  5 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 10  6 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 10  7 mandate included in the bill.

  7 27 interrogations in criminal or juvenile cases.
  7 28    Under the bill, a custodial interrogation at a place of
  7 29 detention, including the giving of any required warning,
  7 30 advice of the rights of the individual being questioned, and
  7 31 the waiver of any rights by the individual, must be recorded
  7 32 electronically in its entirety by both audio and video means if
  7 33 the interrogation relates to any crime or delinquent act.
  7 34    The bill defines "custodial interrogation" to mean
  7 35 questioning or other conduct by a law enforcement officer which
  8  1 is reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from
  8  2 an individual and occurs when reasonable individuals in the
  8  3 same circumstances would consider themselves in custody.
  8  4    The bill defines "place of detention" to mean a fixed
  8  5 location under the control of a law enforcement agency where
  8  6 individuals are questioned about alleged crimes or delinquent
  8  7 acts. The term includes a jail, police or sheriff's station,
  8  8 a law enforcement officer's vehicle, holding cell, and
  8  9 correctional or detention facility.
  8 10    The bill does not require a law enforcement officer to
  8 11 obtain consent or inform the person being interrogated that the
  8 12 interrogation is being electronically recorded.
  8 13    The bill does not apply to a spontaneous statement made
  8 14 outside the course of the custodial interrogation or a
  8 15 statement made in response to a question asked routinely during
  8 16 the processing of the arrest of an individual.
  8 17    The requirements of the bill also do not apply to
  8 18 the following situations: the electronic recording is
  8 19 not reasonably feasible under the circumstances, the
  8 20 individual refuses to participate in the interrogation
  8 21 if the interrogation is being recorded, the interrogation
  8 22 occurs in another jurisdiction in compliance with the other
  8 23 jurisdiction's laws or by federal law enforcement in compliance
  8 24 with federal law, the law enforcement officer has no knowledge
  8 25 of the facts that would lead the officer to reasonably believe
  8 26 that the individual being interrogated committed an act which
  8 27 would require the interrogation to be electronically recorded,
  8 28 the law enforcement officer conducting the interrogation
  8 29 reasonably believes the electronic recording would disclose
  8 30 the identity of a confidential informant or jeopardize the
  8 31 safety of an officer or another individual, or the electronic
  8 32 recording equipment fails.
  8 33    If feasible under the circumstances, the bill requires the
  8 34 reason for not electronically recording an interrogation to be
  8 35 contemporaneously electronically recorded.
  9  1 The bill prohibits a law enforcement officer from
  9  2 encouraging an individual to request an interrogation not be
  9  3 electronically recorded.
  9  4    If the prosecution relies on an exception to not
  9  5 electronically record an interrogation, the bill specifies that
  9  6 the burden is on the prosecution to prove by a preponderance of
  9  7 the evidence that an exception does apply.
  9  8    The bill requires the prosecution to provide written notice
  9  9 to a defendant of the intent to rely upon a statement made in a
  9 10 custodial interrogation which was not electronically recorded
  9 11 within 40 days of arraignment.
  9 12    The bill specifies that the court shall consider the
  9 13 failure to electronically record all or part of a custodial
  9 14 interrogation, unless an exception applies, as a factor in
  9 15 determining whether a statement made during the interrogation
  9 16 is admissible, including whether the statement was voluntarily
  9 17 made.
  9 18    The bill requires each law enforcement agency to establish
  9 19 and enforce procedures to ensure that the electronic recording
  9 20 is identifiable, accessible, and preserved for a period
  9 21 of three years after the date of the limitation for the
  9 22 commencement of a criminal action as set forth in Code chapter
  9 23 802.
  9 24    The bill requires each law enforcement agency to establish
  9 25 rules relating to the following: the manner in which an
  9 26 electronic recording is made including the angle and focus
  9 27 of the camera, supervisory responsibilities, a process
  9 28 that details when noncompliance with procedures occurs, the
  9 29 imposition of administrative sanctions for a failure to comply
  9 30 with the procedures, and a process for monitoring the chain of
  9 31 custody of an electronic recording.
  9 32    The bill does not create a right to require a custodial
  9 33 interrogation to be recorded electronically or require a
  9 34 transcript of an electronically recorded interrogation to be
  9 35 prepared.
 10  1 The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 10  2 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 10  3 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 10  4 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 10  5 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 10  6 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 10  7 mandate included in the bill.

  8  4    The bill defines "place of detention" to mean a fixed
  8  5 location under the control of a law enforcement agency where
  8  6 individuals are questioned about alleged crimes or delinquent
  8  7 acts. The term includes a jail, police or sheriff's station,
  8  8 a law enforcement officer's vehicle, holding cell, and
  8  9 correctional or detention facility.
  8 10    The bill does not require a law enforcement officer to

  8 16 the processing of the arrest of an individual.
  8 17    The requirements of the bill also do not apply to
  8 18 the following situations: the electronic recording is
  8 19 not reasonably feasible under the circumstances, the
  8 20 individual refuses to participate in the interrogation
  8 21 if the interrogation is being recorded, the interrogation
  8 22 occurs in another jurisdiction in compliance with the other

  9  6 the burden is on the prosecution to prove by a preponderance of
  9  7 the evidence that an exception does apply.
  9  8    The bill requires the prosecution to provide written notice
  9  9 to a defendant of the intent to rely upon a statement made in a
  9 10 custodial interrogation which was not electronically recorded

  7 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  7 26    This bill relates to electronic recordings of custodial
  7 27 interrogations in criminal or juvenile cases.
  7 28    Under the bill, a custodial interrogation at a place of
  7 29 detention, including the giving of any required warning,
  7 30 advice of the rights of the individual being questioned, and
  7 31 the waiver of any rights by the individual, must be recorded
  7 32 electronically in its entirety by both audio and video means if
  7 33 the interrogation relates to any crime or delinquent act.
  7 34    The bill defines "custodial interrogation" to mean
  7 35 questioning or other conduct by a law enforcement officer which
  8  1 is reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from
  8  2 an individual and occurs when reasonable individuals in the
  8  3 same circumstances would consider themselves in custody.
  8  4    The bill defines "place of detention" to mean a fixed
  8  5 location under the control of a law enforcement agency where
  8  6 individuals are questioned about alleged crimes or delinquent
  8  7 acts. The term includes a jail, police or sheriff's station,
  8  8 a law enforcement officer's vehicle, holding cell, and
  8  9 correctional or detention facility.
  8 10    The bill does not require a law enforcement officer to
  8 11 obtain consent or inform the person being interrogated that the
  8 12 interrogation is being electronically recorded.
  8 13    The bill does not apply to a spontaneous statement made
  8 14 outside the course of the custodial interrogation or a
  8 15 statement made in response to a question asked routinely during
  8 16 the processing of the arrest of an individual.
  8 17    The requirements of the bill also do not apply to
  8 18 the following situations: the electronic recording is
  8 19 not reasonably feasible under the circumstances, the
  8 20 individual refuses to participate in the interrogation
  8 21 if the interrogation is being recorded, the interrogation
  8 22 occurs in another jurisdiction in compliance with the other
  8 23 jurisdiction's laws or by federal law enforcement in compliance
  8 24 with federal law, the law enforcement officer has no knowledge
  8 25 of the facts that would lead the officer to reasonably believe
  8 26 that the individual being interrogated committed an act which
  8 27 would require the interrogation to be electronically recorded,
  8 28 the law enforcement officer conducting the interrogation
  8 29 reasonably believes the electronic recording would disclose
  8 30 the identity of a confidential informant or jeopardize the
  8 31 safety of an officer or another individual, or the electronic
  8 32 recording equipment fails.
  8 33    If feasible under the circumstances, the bill requires the
  8 34 reason for not electronically recording an interrogation to be
  8 35 contemporaneously electronically recorded.
  9  1 The bill prohibits a law enforcement officer from
  9  2 encouraging an individual to request an interrogation not be
  9  3 electronically recorded.
  9  4    If the prosecution relies on an exception to not
  9  5 electronically record an interrogation, the bill specifies that
  9  6 the burden is on the prosecution to prove by a preponderance of
  9  7 the evidence that an exception does apply.
  9  8    The bill requires the prosecution to provide written notice
  9  9 to a defendant of the intent to rely upon a statement made in a
  9 10 custodial interrogation which was not electronically recorded
  9 11 within 40 days of arraignment.
  9 12    The bill specifies that the court shall consider the
  9 13 failure to electronically record all or part of a custodial
  9 14 interrogation, unless an exception applies, as a factor in
  9 15 determining whether a statement made during the interrogation
  9 16 is admissible, including whether the statement was voluntarily
  9 17 made.
  9 18    The bill requires each law enforcement agency to establish
  9 19 and enforce procedures to ensure that the electronic recording
  9 20 is identifiable, accessible, and preserved for a period
  9 21 of three years after the date of the limitation for the
  9 22 commencement of a criminal action as set forth in Code chapter

  7 26    This bill relates to electronic recordings of custodial
  7 27 interrogations in criminal or juvenile cases.
  7 28    Under the bill, a custodial interrogation at a place of
  7 29 detention, including the giving of any required warning,
  7 30 advice of the rights of the individual being questioned, and
  7 31 the waiver of any rights by the individual, must be recorded
  7 32 electronically in its entirety by both audio and video means if
  7 33 the interrogation relates to any crime or delinquent act.
  7 34    The bill defines "custodial interrogation" to mean
  7 35 questioning or other conduct by a law enforcement officer which
  8  1 is reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from
  8  2 an individual and occurs when reasonable individuals in the
  8  3 same circumstances would consider themselves in custody.
  8  4    The bill defines "place of detention" to mean a fixed
  8  5 location under the control of a law enforcement agency where
  8  6 individuals are questioned about alleged crimes or delinquent
  8  7 acts. The term includes a jail, police or sheriff's station,
  8  8 a law enforcement officer's vehicle, holding cell, and
  8  9 correctional or detention facility.
  8 10    The bill does not require a law enforcement officer to
  8 11 obtain consent or inform the person being interrogated that the
  8 12 interrogation is being electronically recorded.
  8 13    The bill does not apply to a spontaneous statement made
  8 14 outside the course of the custodial interrogation or a
  8 15 statement made in response to a question asked routinely during
  8 16 the processing of the arrest of an individual.
  8 17    The requirements of the bill also do not apply to
  8 18 the following situations: the electronic recording is
  8 19 not reasonably feasible under the circumstances, the
  8 20 individual refuses to participate in the interrogation
  8 21 if the interrogation is being recorded, the interrogation
  8 22 occurs in another jurisdiction in compliance with the other
  8 23 jurisdiction's laws or by federal law enforcement in compliance
  8 24 with federal law, the law enforcement officer has no knowledge
  8 25 of the facts that would lead the officer to reasonably believe
  8 26 that the individual being interrogated committed an act which
  8 27 would require the interrogation to be electronically recorded,
  8 28 the law enforcement officer conducting the interrogation
  8 29 reasonably believes the electronic recording would disclose
  8 30 the identity of a confidential informant or jeopardize the
  8 31 safety of an officer or another individual, or the electronic
  8 32 recording equipment fails.

  9  2 encouraging an individual to request an interrogation not be
  9  3 electronically recorded.
  9  4    If the prosecution relies on an exception to not
  9  5 electronically record an interrogation, the bill specifies that
  9  6 the burden is on the prosecution to prove by a preponderance of
  9  7 the evidence that an exception does apply.
  9  8    The bill requires the prosecution to provide written notice
  9  9 to a defendant of the intent to rely upon a statement made in a
  9 10 custodial interrogation which was not electronically recorded
  9 11 within 40 days of arraignment.
