  2 33 district cost per pupil, subject to limitations established in

  3  2 eligible electors equal in number to at least 30 percent of
  3  3 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding regular
  3  4 school election, direct the county commissioner of elections
  3  5 to submit to the registered voters of the school district the
  3  6 question of whether to increase the school district's regular
  3  7 program district cost per pupil. The ballot must specify the
  3  8 amount by which the regular program district cost per pupil
  3  9 is to be increased and the budget year for which the increase
  3 10 will take effect. If a majority of the votes cast upon the

  3 12 of management is required to increase the school district's
  3 13 regular program district cost per pupil by the amount approved

  3 16 the election approving the increase must occur before the
  3 17 school district's budget for that budget year is certified
  3 18 under Code section 24.17.

  3 27 not exceed an amount equal to the difference between the school
  3 28 district's regular program district cost per pupil and the
  3 29 highest regular program district cost per pupil among all
  3 30 school districts in the state.
  3 31    The bill also specifies that existing Code language related
  3 32 to adjustments to a school district's regular program district
  3 33 cost per pupil if certain conditions are met provides for a
  3 34 different adjustment if certain other conditions are met.

  2 32 approve an increase in a school district's regular program
  2 33 district cost per pupil, subject to limitations established in

  3  2 eligible electors equal in number to at least 30 percent of
  3  3 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding regular
  3  4 school election, direct the county commissioner of elections
  3  5 to submit to the registered voters of the school district the
  3  6 question of whether to increase the school district's regular
  3  7 program district cost per pupil. The ballot must specify the
  3  8 amount by which the regular program district cost per pupil
  3  9 is to be increased and the budget year for which the increase
  3 10 will take effect. If a majority of the votes cast upon the

  3 12 of management is required to increase the school district's
  3 13 regular program district cost per pupil by the amount approved

  3 28 district's regular program district cost per pupil and the

  3 30 school districts in the state.
  3 31    The bill also specifies that existing Code language related
  3 32 to adjustments to a school district's regular program district
  3 33 cost per pupil if certain conditions are met provides for a
  3 34 different adjustment if certain other conditions are met.

  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill authorizes the voters of a school district to
  2 32 approve an increase in a school district's regular program
  2 33 district cost per pupil, subject to limitations established in
  2 34 the bill.
  2 35    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3  1 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3  2 eligible electors equal in number to at least 30 percent of
  3  3 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding regular
  3  4 school election, direct the county commissioner of elections
  3  5 to submit to the registered voters of the school district the
  3  6 question of whether to increase the school district's regular
  3  7 program district cost per pupil. The ballot must specify the
  3  8 amount by which the regular program district cost per pupil
  3  9 is to be increased and the budget year for which the increase
  3 10 will take effect. If a majority of the votes cast upon the
  3 11 proposition is in favor of the proposition, the department
  3 12 of management is required to increase the school district's
  3 13 regular program district cost per pupil by the amount approved
  3 14 by the voters beginning with the budget year specified on the
  3 15 ballot.  However, for an increase to apply to a budget year,
  3 16 the election approving the increase must occur before the
  3 17 school district's budget for that budget year is certified
  3 18 under Code section 24.17.
  3 19    When a proposition to authorize an increase in a school
  3 20 district's regular program district cost per pupil has been
  3 21 submitted to the electors and the proposition fails to gain
  3 22 approval, another proposition may not be submitted to the
  3 23 electors for a period of six months from the date of election
  3 24 at which the proposition failed.
  3 25    Under the bill, the amount by which a school district's
  3 26 regular program district cost per pupil may be increased shall
  3 27 not exceed an amount equal to the difference between the school
  3 28 district's regular program district cost per pupil and the
  3 29 highest regular program district cost per pupil among all
  3 30 school districts in the state.
  3 31    The bill also specifies that existing Code language related
  3 32 to adjustments to a school district's regular program district
  3 33 cost per pupil if certain conditions are met provides for a
  3 34 different adjustment if certain other conditions are met.

  2 31    This bill authorizes the voters of a school district to
  2 32 approve an increase in a school district's regular program
  2 33 district cost per pupil, subject to limitations established in
  2 34 the bill.
  2 35    The board of directors of a school district may, on its
  3  1 own motion, or shall, upon receipt of a petition signed by
  3  2 eligible electors equal in number to at least 30 percent of
  3  3 the number of voters who voted at the last preceding regular
  3  4 school election, direct the county commissioner of elections
  3  5 to submit to the registered voters of the school district the
  3  6 question of whether to increase the school district's regular
  3  7 program district cost per pupil. The ballot must specify the
  3  8 amount by which the regular program district cost per pupil
  3  9 is to be increased and the budget year for which the increase
  3 10 will take effect. If a majority of the votes cast upon the
  3 11 proposition is in favor of the proposition, the department
  3 12 of management is required to increase the school district's
  3 13 regular program district cost per pupil by the amount approved
  3 14 by the voters beginning with the budget year specified on the
  3 15 ballot.  However, for an increase to apply to a budget year,
  3 16 the election approving the increase must occur before the
  3 17 school district's budget for that budget year is certified
  3 18 under Code section 24.17.
  3 19    When a proposition to authorize an increase in a school
  3 20 district's regular program district cost per pupil has been
  3 21 submitted to the electors and the proposition fails to gain
  3 22 approval, another proposition may not be submitted to the
  3 23 electors for a period of six months from the date of election
  3 24 at which the proposition failed.
  3 25    Under the bill, the amount by which a school district's
  3 26 regular program district cost per pupil may be increased shall
  3 27 not exceed an amount equal to the difference between the school
  3 28 district's regular program district cost per pupil and the
  3 29 highest regular program district cost per pupil among all
  3 30 school districts in the state.
  3 31    The bill also specifies that existing Code language related
  3 32 to adjustments to a school district's regular program district
  3 33 cost per pupil if certain conditions are met provides for a
  3 34 different adjustment if certain other conditions are met.

  4  1 July 1, 2018.
