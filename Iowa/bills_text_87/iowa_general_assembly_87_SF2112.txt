  1  8 requirements pursuant to section 514I.8 with the exception
  1  9 of age, the option of purchasing coverage through the hawk=i

  1 14 marketplace.

  2 22 to the chairpersons and ranking members of the human resources
  2 23 committees and the joint appropriations subcommittee on health
  2 24 and human services by September 1, 2018, on the progress of the
  2 25 federal waivers and the results from actuarial and economic
  2 26 analyses that are necessary for a waiver proposal.  The report
  2 27 shall also include recommendations regarding any statutory or
  2 28 administrative rule changes necessary to implement the program.
  2 29    Sec. 2.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act, being deemed of immediate

  3 34 and negative impacts to premiums in the individual and
  3 35 group insurance market both inside and outside of the health
  4  1 insurance marketplace.

  4 13 operations; and reimbursement mechanisms to address potential
  4 14 increased costs to the hawk=i program.
  4 15    The director of the department of human services in

  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill directs the director of human services to seek
  3  4 necessary federal waiver authority to:  establish a program
  3  5 that allows individuals with incomes above the maximum income
  3  6 eligibility limit under the hawk=i program (currently 300
  3  7 percent of the federal poverty level), and who otherwise meet
  3  8 the hawk=i program eligibility requirements (with the exception
  3  9 of the age limitation of less than 19 years of age), the
  3 10 option of purchasing coverage for a child through the hawk=i
  3 11 program rather than purchasing a qualified health plan through
  3 12 the health insurance marketplace established pursuant to the
  3 13 federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or an
  3 14 individual health plan offered outside of the health insurance
  3 15 marketplace; to allow individuals who qualify and choose to
  3 16 purchase coverage through the hawk=i  program to use advanced
  3 17 tax credits and cost=sharing credits, if eligible, to purchase
  3 18 the option; to permit the hawk=i program purchase option to be
  3 19 offered through the health insurance marketplace as a coverage
  3 20 option and to be compared with qualified health plans offered
  3 21 through the health insurance marketplace; and notwithstanding
  3 22 the eligibility criterion that a child must be less than 19
  3 23 years of age, allow the hawk=i purchase option to be offered to
  3 24 a child up to 26 years of age.
  3 25    The bill directs the director of the department of human
  3 26 services to coordinate the administration of the hawk=i
  3 27 program with the hawk=i program purchase option to maximize
  3 28 efficiencies and improve the continuity of care for eligible
  3 29 children; and to  implement mechanisms to ensure the long=term
  3 30 financial sustainability of the hawk=i program and mitigate any
  3 31 adverse financial impacts to the health insurance marketplace.
  3 32 The mechanisms are to address issues related to minimizing
  3 33 adverse selection, the state financial risk and contribution,
  3 34 and negative impacts to premiums in the individual and
  3 35 group insurance market both inside and outside of the health
  4  1 insurance marketplace.
  4  2    At a minimum, the hawk=i purchase option must include:
  4  3 establishment of an annual per enrollee premium rate similar
  4  4 to the average rate paid by the state to managed care plan
  4  5 contractors under the hawk=i program; establishment of a
  4  6 benefit set equal to the benefits covered under the hawk=i
  4  7 program; establishment of annual open enrollment periods
  4  8 consistent with those for the hawk=i program; the ability of
  4  9 the director of the department of human services to adjust the
  4 10 purchase option's actuarial value to a value no lower than
  4 11 87 percent; reimbursement mechanisms to address potential
  4 12 reductions in funding for health insurance marketplace
  4 13 operations; and reimbursement mechanisms to address potential
  4 14 increased costs to the hawk=i program.
  4 15    The director of the department of human services in
  4 16 collaboration with the commissioner of insurance shall report
  4 17 to the chairpersons and ranking members of the house and
  4 18 senate human resources committees and the joint appropriations
  4 19 subcommittee on health and human services by September 1,
  4 20 2018, on the progress of the federal waivers and the results
  4 21 from actuarial and economic analyses that are necessary for a
  4 22 waiver proposal.  The report shall also include recommendations
  4 23 regarding any statutory or administrative rule changes
  4 24 necessary to implement the program.
  4 25    The bill takes effect upon enactment.  Implementation of any
  4 26 waiver provision that requires a state financial contribution
  4 27 is contingent on further legislative action to approve the
  4 28 state's contribution.

  2 35                           EXPLANATION
  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill directs the director of human services to seek
  3  4 necessary federal waiver authority to:  establish a program
  3  5 that allows individuals with incomes above the maximum income
  3  6 eligibility limit under the hawk=i program (currently 300
  3  7 percent of the federal poverty level), and who otherwise meet
  3  8 the hawk=i program eligibility requirements (with the exception
  3  9 of the age limitation of less than 19 years of age), the
  3 10 option of purchasing coverage for a child through the hawk=i
  3 11 program rather than purchasing a qualified health plan through
  3 12 the health insurance marketplace established pursuant to the
  3 13 federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or an
  3 14 individual health plan offered outside of the health insurance
  3 15 marketplace; to allow individuals who qualify and choose to
  3 16 purchase coverage through the hawk=i  program to use advanced
  3 17 tax credits and cost=sharing credits, if eligible, to purchase
  3 18 the option; to permit the hawk=i program purchase option to be
  3 19 offered through the health insurance marketplace as a coverage
  3 20 option and to be compared with qualified health plans offered
  3 21 through the health insurance marketplace; and notwithstanding
  3 22 the eligibility criterion that a child must be less than 19
  3 23 years of age, allow the hawk=i purchase option to be offered to
  3 24 a child up to 26 years of age.
  3 25    The bill directs the director of the department of human
  3 26 services to coordinate the administration of the hawk=i
  3 27 program with the hawk=i program purchase option to maximize
  3 28 efficiencies and improve the continuity of care for eligible
  3 29 children; and to  implement mechanisms to ensure the long=term
  3 30 financial sustainability of the hawk=i program and mitigate any
  3 31 adverse financial impacts to the health insurance marketplace.
  3 32 The mechanisms are to address issues related to minimizing
  3 33 adverse selection, the state financial risk and contribution,
  3 34 and negative impacts to premiums in the individual and
  3 35 group insurance market both inside and outside of the health
  4  1 insurance marketplace.
  4  2    At a minimum, the hawk=i purchase option must include:
  4  3 establishment of an annual per enrollee premium rate similar
  4  4 to the average rate paid by the state to managed care plan
  4  5 contractors under the hawk=i program; establishment of a
  4  6 benefit set equal to the benefits covered under the hawk=i
  4  7 program; establishment of annual open enrollment periods
  4  8 consistent with those for the hawk=i program; the ability of
  4  9 the director of the department of human services to adjust the
  4 10 purchase option's actuarial value to a value no lower than
  4 11 87 percent; reimbursement mechanisms to address potential
  4 12 reductions in funding for health insurance marketplace
  4 13 operations; and reimbursement mechanisms to address potential
  4 14 increased costs to the hawk=i program.
  4 15    The director of the department of human services in
  4 16 collaboration with the commissioner of insurance shall report
  4 17 to the chairpersons and ranking members of the house and
  4 18 senate human resources committees and the joint appropriations
  4 19 subcommittee on health and human services by September 1,
  4 20 2018, on the progress of the federal waivers and the results
  4 21 from actuarial and economic analyses that are necessary for a
  4 22 waiver proposal.  The report shall also include recommendations
  4 23 regarding any statutory or administrative rule changes
  4 24 necessary to implement the program.
  4 25    The bill takes effect upon enactment.  Implementation of any
  4 26 waiver provision that requires a state financial contribution
  4 27 is contingent on further legislative action to approve the

  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill directs the director of human services to seek
  3  4 necessary federal waiver authority to:  establish a program
  3  5 that allows individuals with incomes above the maximum income
  3  6 eligibility limit under the hawk=i program (currently 300
  3  7 percent of the federal poverty level), and who otherwise meet
  3  8 the hawk=i program eligibility requirements (with the exception
  3  9 of the age limitation of less than 19 years of age), the
  3 10 option of purchasing coverage for a child through the hawk=i
  3 11 program rather than purchasing a qualified health plan through
  3 12 the health insurance marketplace established pursuant to the
  3 13 federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or an
  3 14 individual health plan offered outside of the health insurance
  3 15 marketplace; to allow individuals who qualify and choose to
  3 16 purchase coverage through the hawk=i  program to use advanced
  3 17 tax credits and cost=sharing credits, if eligible, to purchase
  3 18 the option; to permit the hawk=i program purchase option to be
  3 19 offered through the health insurance marketplace as a coverage
  3 20 option and to be compared with qualified health plans offered
  3 21 through the health insurance marketplace; and notwithstanding
  3 22 the eligibility criterion that a child must be less than 19
  3 23 years of age, allow the hawk=i purchase option to be offered to
  3 24 a child up to 26 years of age.
  3 25    The bill directs the director of the department of human

  3 27 program with the hawk=i program purchase option to maximize
  3 28 efficiencies and improve the continuity of care for eligible
  3 29 children; and to  implement mechanisms to ensure the long=term
  3 30 financial sustainability of the hawk=i program and mitigate any
  3 31 adverse financial impacts to the health insurance marketplace.
  3 32 The mechanisms are to address issues related to minimizing
  3 33 adverse selection, the state financial risk and contribution,
  3 34 and negative impacts to premiums in the individual and
  3 35 group insurance market both inside and outside of the health
  4  1 insurance marketplace.
  4  2    At a minimum, the hawk=i purchase option must include:
  4  3 establishment of an annual per enrollee premium rate similar
  4  4 to the average rate paid by the state to managed care plan
  4  5 contractors under the hawk=i program; establishment of a
  4  6 benefit set equal to the benefits covered under the hawk=i
  4  7 program; establishment of annual open enrollment periods

  4 13 operations; and reimbursement mechanisms to address potential
  4 14 increased costs to the hawk=i program.
  4 15    The director of the department of human services in
  4 16 collaboration with the commissioner of insurance shall report
  4 17 to the chairpersons and ranking members of the house and
  4 18 senate human resources committees and the joint appropriations

  4 21 from actuarial and economic analyses that are necessary for a
  4 22 waiver proposal.  The report shall also include recommendations
  4 23 regarding any statutory or administrative rule changes
  4 24 necessary to implement the program.
  4 25    The bill takes effect upon enactment.  Implementation of any
  4 26 waiver provision that requires a state financial contribution

  3  8 the hawk=i program eligibility requirements (with the exception
  3  9 of the age limitation of less than 19 years of age), the

  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill directs the director of human services to seek
  3  4 necessary federal waiver authority to:  establish a program
  3  5 that allows individuals with incomes above the maximum income
  3  6 eligibility limit under the hawk=i program (currently 300
  3  7 percent of the federal poverty level), and who otherwise meet
  3  8 the hawk=i program eligibility requirements (with the exception
  3  9 of the age limitation of less than 19 years of age), the
  3 10 option of purchasing coverage for a child through the hawk=i
  3 11 program rather than purchasing a qualified health plan through
  3 12 the health insurance marketplace established pursuant to the
  3 13 federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or an
  3 14 individual health plan offered outside of the health insurance
  3 15 marketplace; to allow individuals who qualify and choose to
  3 16 purchase coverage through the hawk=i  program to use advanced
  3 17 tax credits and cost=sharing credits, if eligible, to purchase
  3 18 the option; to permit the hawk=i program purchase option to be
  3 19 offered through the health insurance marketplace as a coverage
  3 20 option and to be compared with qualified health plans offered
  3 21 through the health insurance marketplace; and notwithstanding
  3 22 the eligibility criterion that a child must be less than 19
  3 23 years of age, allow the hawk=i purchase option to be offered to
  3 24 a child up to 26 years of age.
  3 25    The bill directs the director of the department of human
  3 26 services to coordinate the administration of the hawk=i
  3 27 program with the hawk=i program purchase option to maximize
  3 28 efficiencies and improve the continuity of care for eligible
  3 29 children; and to  implement mechanisms to ensure the long=term
  3 30 financial sustainability of the hawk=i program and mitigate any
  3 31 adverse financial impacts to the health insurance marketplace.
  3 32 The mechanisms are to address issues related to minimizing
  3 33 adverse selection, the state financial risk and contribution,
  3 34 and negative impacts to premiums in the individual and
  3 35 group insurance market both inside and outside of the health
  4  1 insurance marketplace.
  4  2    At a minimum, the hawk=i purchase option must include:
  4  3 establishment of an annual per enrollee premium rate similar
  4  4 to the average rate paid by the state to managed care plan
  4  5 contractors under the hawk=i program; establishment of a
  4  6 benefit set equal to the benefits covered under the hawk=i
  4  7 program; establishment of annual open enrollment periods
  4  8 consistent with those for the hawk=i program; the ability of
  4  9 the director of the department of human services to adjust the
  4 10 purchase option's actuarial value to a value no lower than
  4 11 87 percent; reimbursement mechanisms to address potential
  4 12 reductions in funding for health insurance marketplace
  4 13 operations; and reimbursement mechanisms to address potential
  4 14 increased costs to the hawk=i program.
  4 15    The director of the department of human services in

  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill directs the director of human services to seek
  3  4 necessary federal waiver authority to:  establish a program
  3  5 that allows individuals with incomes above the maximum income
  3  6 eligibility limit under the hawk=i program (currently 300
  3  7 percent of the federal poverty level), and who otherwise meet
  3  8 the hawk=i program eligibility requirements (with the exception
  3  9 of the age limitation of less than 19 years of age), the
  3 10 option of purchasing coverage for a child through the hawk=i
  3 11 program rather than purchasing a qualified health plan through
  3 12 the health insurance marketplace established pursuant to the
  3 13 federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or an
  3 14 individual health plan offered outside of the health insurance
  3 15 marketplace; to allow individuals who qualify and choose to
  3 16 purchase coverage through the hawk=i  program to use advanced
  3 17 tax credits and cost=sharing credits, if eligible, to purchase
  3 18 the option; to permit the hawk=i program purchase option to be
  3 19 offered through the health insurance marketplace as a coverage
  3 20 option and to be compared with qualified health plans offered
  3 21 through the health insurance marketplace; and notwithstanding
  3 22 the eligibility criterion that a child must be less than 19
  3 23 years of age, allow the hawk=i purchase option to be offered to
  3 24 a child up to 26 years of age.
  3 25    The bill directs the director of the department of human
  3 26 services to coordinate the administration of the hawk=i
  3 27 program with the hawk=i program purchase option to maximize
  3 28 efficiencies and improve the continuity of care for eligible
  3 29 children; and to  implement mechanisms to ensure the long=term
  3 30 financial sustainability of the hawk=i program and mitigate any
  3 31 adverse financial impacts to the health insurance marketplace.
  3 32 The mechanisms are to address issues related to minimizing
  3 33 adverse selection, the state financial risk and contribution,
  3 34 and negative impacts to premiums in the individual and
  3 35 group insurance market both inside and outside of the health
  4  1 insurance marketplace.
  4  2    At a minimum, the hawk=i purchase option must include:
  4  3 establishment of an annual per enrollee premium rate similar
  4  4 to the average rate paid by the state to managed care plan
  4  5 contractors under the hawk=i program; establishment of a
  4  6 benefit set equal to the benefits covered under the hawk=i
  4  7 program; establishment of annual open enrollment periods
  4  8 consistent with those for the hawk=i program; the ability of
  4  9 the director of the department of human services to adjust the
  4 10 purchase option's actuarial value to a value no lower than
  4 11 87 percent; reimbursement mechanisms to address potential
  4 12 reductions in funding for health insurance marketplace
  4 13 operations; and reimbursement mechanisms to address potential
  4 14 increased costs to the hawk=i program.
  4 15    The director of the department of human services in

  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill directs the director of human services to seek
  3  4 necessary federal waiver authority to:  establish a program
  3  5 that allows individuals with incomes above the maximum income
  3  6 eligibility limit under the hawk=i program (currently 300
  3  7 percent of the federal poverty level), and who otherwise meet
  3  8 the hawk=i program eligibility requirements (with the exception
  3  9 of the age limitation of less than 19 years of age), the
  3 10 option of purchasing coverage for a child through the hawk=i
  3 11 program rather than purchasing a qualified health plan through
  3 12 the health insurance marketplace established pursuant to the
  3 13 federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or an
  3 14 individual health plan offered outside of the health insurance
  3 15 marketplace; to allow individuals who qualify and choose to
  3 16 purchase coverage through the hawk=i  program to use advanced
  3 17 tax credits and cost=sharing credits, if eligible, to purchase
  3 18 the option; to permit the hawk=i program purchase option to be
  3 19 offered through the health insurance marketplace as a coverage
  3 20 option and to be compared with qualified health plans offered
  3 21 through the health insurance marketplace; and notwithstanding
  3 22 the eligibility criterion that a child must be less than 19
  3 23 years of age, allow the hawk=i purchase option to be offered to
  3 24 a child up to 26 years of age.
  3 25    The bill directs the director of the department of human
  3 26 services to coordinate the administration of the hawk=i
  3 27 program with the hawk=i program purchase option to maximize
  3 28 efficiencies and improve the continuity of care for eligible
  3 29 children; and to  implement mechanisms to ensure the long=term
  3 30 financial sustainability of the hawk=i program and mitigate any
  3 31 adverse financial impacts to the health insurance marketplace.
  3 32 The mechanisms are to address issues related to minimizing
  3 33 adverse selection, the state financial risk and contribution,
  3 34 and negative impacts to premiums in the individual and
  3 35 group insurance market both inside and outside of the health
  4  1 insurance marketplace.
  4  2    At a minimum, the hawk=i purchase option must include:
  4  3 establishment of an annual per enrollee premium rate similar
  4  4 to the average rate paid by the state to managed care plan
  4  5 contractors under the hawk=i program; establishment of a
  4  6 benefit set equal to the benefits covered under the hawk=i
  4  7 program; establishment of annual open enrollment periods
  4  8 consistent with those for the hawk=i program; the ability of
  4  9 the director of the department of human services to adjust the
  4 10 purchase option's actuarial value to a value no lower than
  4 11 87 percent; reimbursement mechanisms to address potential
  4 12 reductions in funding for health insurance marketplace

  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill directs the director of human services to seek
  3  4 necessary federal waiver authority to:  establish a program
  3  5 that allows individuals with incomes above the maximum income
  3  6 eligibility limit under the hawk=i program (currently 300
  3  7 percent of the federal poverty level), and who otherwise meet
  3  8 the hawk=i program eligibility requirements (with the exception
  3  9 of the age limitation of less than 19 years of age), the
  3 10 option of purchasing coverage for a child through the hawk=i
  3 11 program rather than purchasing a qualified health plan through
  3 12 the health insurance marketplace established pursuant to the
  3 13 federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or an
  3 14 individual health plan offered outside of the health insurance
  3 15 marketplace; to allow individuals who qualify and choose to
  3 16 purchase coverage through the hawk=i  program to use advanced
  3 17 tax credits and cost=sharing credits, if eligible, to purchase
  3 18 the option; to permit the hawk=i program purchase option to be
  3 19 offered through the health insurance marketplace as a coverage
  3 20 option and to be compared with qualified health plans offered
  3 21 through the health insurance marketplace; and notwithstanding
  3 22 the eligibility criterion that a child must be less than 19
  3 23 years of age, allow the hawk=i purchase option to be offered to
  3 24 a child up to 26 years of age.
  3 25    The bill directs the director of the department of human
  3 26 services to coordinate the administration of the hawk=i
  3 27 program with the hawk=i program purchase option to maximize

  3 29 children; and to  implement mechanisms to ensure the long=term
  3 30 financial sustainability of the hawk=i program and mitigate any
  3 31 adverse financial impacts to the health insurance marketplace.
  3 32 The mechanisms are to address issues related to minimizing
  3 33 adverse selection, the state financial risk and contribution,
  3 34 and negative impacts to premiums in the individual and
  3 35 group insurance market both inside and outside of the health
  4  1 insurance marketplace.
  4  2    At a minimum, the hawk=i purchase option must include:
  4  3 establishment of an annual per enrollee premium rate similar
  4  4 to the average rate paid by the state to managed care plan
  4  5 contractors under the hawk=i program; establishment of a
  4  6 benefit set equal to the benefits covered under the hawk=i

  3  5 that allows individuals with incomes above the maximum income
  3  6 eligibility limit under the hawk=i program (currently 300
  3  7 percent of the federal poverty level), and who otherwise meet
  3  8 the hawk=i program eligibility requirements (with the exception
  3  9 of the age limitation of less than 19 years of age), the
  3 10 option of purchasing coverage for a child through the hawk=i
  3 11 program rather than purchasing a qualified health plan through
  3 12 the health insurance marketplace established pursuant to the
  3 13 federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or an
  3 14 individual health plan offered outside of the health insurance
  3 15 marketplace; to allow individuals who qualify and choose to
  3 16 purchase coverage through the hawk=i  program to use advanced
  3 17 tax credits and cost=sharing credits, if eligible, to purchase
  3 18 the option; to permit the hawk=i program purchase option to be
  3 19 offered through the health insurance marketplace as a coverage
  3 20 option and to be compared with qualified health plans offered
  3 21 through the health insurance marketplace; and notwithstanding
  3 22 the eligibility criterion that a child must be less than 19
  3 23 years of age, allow the hawk=i purchase option to be offered to

  3 29 children; and to  implement mechanisms to ensure the long=term
  3 30 financial sustainability of the hawk=i program and mitigate any
  3 31 adverse financial impacts to the health insurance marketplace.
  3 32 The mechanisms are to address issues related to minimizing
  3 33 adverse selection, the state financial risk and contribution,
  3 34 and negative impacts to premiums in the individual and
  3 35 group insurance market both inside and outside of the health
  4  1 insurance marketplace.
  4  2    At a minimum, the hawk=i purchase option must include:
  4  3 establishment of an annual per enrollee premium rate similar
  4  4 to the average rate paid by the state to managed care plan
  4  5 contractors under the hawk=i program; establishment of a
  4  6 benefit set equal to the benefits covered under the hawk=i
  4  7 program; establishment of annual open enrollment periods
  4  8 consistent with those for the hawk=i program; the ability of

  4 12 reductions in funding for health insurance marketplace
  4 13 operations; and reimbursement mechanisms to address potential
  4 14 increased costs to the hawk=i program.
  4 15    The director of the department of human services in

  3  1 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3  2 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3  3    This bill directs the director of human services to seek
  3  4 necessary federal waiver authority to:  establish a program
  3  5 that allows individuals with incomes above the maximum income
  3  6 eligibility limit under the hawk=i program (currently 300
  3  7 percent of the federal poverty level), and who otherwise meet
  3  8 the hawk=i program eligibility requirements (with the exception
  3  9 of the age limitation of less than 19 years of age), the
  3 10 option of purchasing coverage for a child through the hawk=i
  3 11 program rather than purchasing a qualified health plan through
  3 12 the health insurance marketplace established pursuant to the
  3 13 federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or an
  3 14 individual health plan offered outside of the health insurance
  3 15 marketplace; to allow individuals who qualify and choose to
  3 16 purchase coverage through the hawk=i  program to use advanced
  3 17 tax credits and cost=sharing credits, if eligible, to purchase
  3 18 the option; to permit the hawk=i program purchase option to be
  3 19 offered through the health insurance marketplace as a coverage
  3 20 option and to be compared with qualified health plans offered
  3 21 through the health insurance marketplace; and notwithstanding
  3 22 the eligibility criterion that a child must be less than 19
  3 23 years of age, allow the hawk=i purchase option to be offered to
  3 24 a child up to 26 years of age.
  3 25    The bill directs the director of the department of human
  3 26 services to coordinate the administration of the hawk=i
  3 27 program with the hawk=i program purchase option to maximize
  3 28 efficiencies and improve the continuity of care for eligible
  3 29 children; and to  implement mechanisms to ensure the long=term
  3 30 financial sustainability of the hawk=i program and mitigate any
  3 31 adverse financial impacts to the health insurance marketplace.
  3 32 The mechanisms are to address issues related to minimizing
  3 33 adverse selection, the state financial risk and contribution,
  3 34 and negative impacts to premiums in the individual and
  3 35 group insurance market both inside and outside of the health
  4  1 insurance marketplace.
  4  2    At a minimum, the hawk=i purchase option must include:
  4  3 establishment of an annual per enrollee premium rate similar
  4  4 to the average rate paid by the state to managed care plan
  4  5 contractors under the hawk=i program; establishment of a
  4  6 benefit set equal to the benefits covered under the hawk=i
  4  7 program; establishment of annual open enrollment periods
  4  8 consistent with those for the hawk=i program; the ability of
  4  9 the director of the department of human services to adjust the
  4 10 purchase option's actuarial value to a value no lower than
  4 11 87 percent; reimbursement mechanisms to address potential
  4 12 reductions in funding for health insurance marketplace
  4 13 operations; and reimbursement mechanisms to address potential
  4 14 increased costs to the hawk=i program.
  4 15    The director of the department of human services in
  4 16 collaboration with the commissioner of insurance shall report
  4 17 to the chairpersons and ranking members of the house and
  4 18 senate human resources committees and the joint appropriations
  4 19 subcommittee on health and human services by September 1,
  4 20 2018, on the progress of the federal waivers and the results
  4 21 from actuarial and economic analyses that are necessary for a
  4 22 waiver proposal.  The report shall also include recommendations
  4 23 regarding any statutory or administrative rule changes
  4 24 necessary to implement the program.

  4 26 waiver provision that requires a state financial contribution
