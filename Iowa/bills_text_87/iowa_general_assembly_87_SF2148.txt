  1 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 32    This bill prohibits the state or a political subdivision of
  1 33 the state from placing or causing to be placed on or adjacent
  1 34 to a highway, or maintaining or employing the use of, any
  1 35 automated or remote system for traffic law enforcement. The
  2  1 bill defines "automated or remote system for traffic law
  2  2 enforcement" to mean a camera or other optical device designed
  2  3 to work in conjunction with an official traffic control signal
  2  4 or speed measuring device to identify motor vehicles operating
  2  5 in violation of traffic laws, the use of which results in the
  2  6 issuance of citations sent through the mail or by electronic
  2  7 means.
  2  8    The bill requires that prior to July 1, 2018, a local
  2  9 authority using an automated or remote system for traffic law
  2 10 enforcement must discontinue using the system and remove the
  2 11 system equipment. Effective July 1, 2018, all local ordinances
  2 12 authorizing the use of automated or remote systems for traffic
  2 13 law enforcement are void. However, the bill provides that any
  2 14 citation issued or mailed pursuant to such an ordinance prior
  2 15 to July 1, 2018, is not invalidated by the bill and must be
  2 16 processed according to the provisions of law under which the
