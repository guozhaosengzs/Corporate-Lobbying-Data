 14 11                           EXPLANATION
 14 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 14    This bill relates to the approval and imposition of the
 14 15 local option sales and services tax.  Current Code chapter 423B
 14 16 authorizes the imposition of local option taxes, including
 14 17 a local option sales and services tax. Currently, such a
 14 18 proposed tax is only presented to the voters of a whole county
 14 19 upon the filing of a petition signed by eligible electors of
 14 20 the county equal in number to 5 percent of the persons in
 14 21 the county who voted at the last preceding general election
 14 22 or upon receipt by the county commissioner of elections of
 14 23 motions requesting such submission, adopted by the governing
 14 24 bodies of the cities located within the county or the governing
 14 25 body of the county for the unincorporated area of the county,
 14 26 representing at least one=half of the population of the county.
 14 27    The bill amends the methods of seeking presentment of the
 14 28 local option sales and services tax to the voters of certain
 14 29 qualified counties by allowing the eligible electors of
 14 30 individual cities and the unincorporated area of a county to
 14 31 file a petition for an election to be held in the petitioning
 14 32 jurisdiction if such petition is signed by eligible electors
 14 33 of the city or the unincorporated area of the county, as
 14 34 applicable, equal in number to 5 percent of the persons in
 14 35 the applicable city or unincorporated area of the county who
 15  1 voted at the last preceding general election.  The bill defines
 15  2 "qualified county" to mean a county with a population in excess
 15  3 of 400,000, a county with a population of at least 130,000 but
 15  4 not more than 131,000, or a county with a population of at
 15  5 least 60,000 but not more than 70,000, according to the 2010
 15  6 federal decennial census. For those qualified counties, the
 15  7 bill also removes the requirement that in order to have the
 15  8 local sales and services tax presented to the voters, motions
 15  9 must be approved by cities or the county for the unincorporated
 15 10 area, representing at least one=half of the county's
 15 11 population. Instead, the bill allows individual cities or the
 15 12 county for the unincorporated area within a qualified county
 15 13 to approve a motion for an election on the local sales and
 15 14 services tax to be held in only that jurisdiction.
 15 15    The bill specifies that except for purposes of allocating
 15 16 local sales and services tax receipts based on the county in
 15 17 which the tax was collected, a city shall be deemed to be
 15 18 located in a qualified county if a majority of the population
 15 19 of the city, according to the 2010 federal decennial census,
 15 20 resides in the qualified county.
 15 21    The bill provides that in a qualified county a city or the
 15 22 board of supervisors for the unincorporated area of a county
 15 23 may repeal the local sales and services tax in the city upon
 15 24 adoption of its own motion for repeal.
 15 25    For those counties that are not qualified counties, the
 15 26 methods of seeking presentment of the local option sales and
 15 27 services tax to the voters and the methods for repealing such
 15 28 a tax remain the same as required under current Code chapter
 15 29 423B.
 15 30    The bill provides that each city or county for which the
 15 31 imposition of the local sales and services tax was approved at
 15 32 election on or after the effective date of the bill shall use
 15 33 not less than 50 percent of the moneys received for property
 15 34 tax relief.
 15 35    The bill strikes special provisions related to the approval
 16  1 and imposition of a local sales and services tax in a city that
 16  2 is located in two or more contiguous counties.
 16  3    The bill provides that a local sales and services tax is
 16  4 not applicable to transactions of a retailer holding a retail
 16  5 sales tax permit at a place of business if the retailer's place
 16  6 of business is located in part within a city or unincorporated
 16  7 area of the county where the tax is not imposed.
 16  8    Current Code chapter 423B authorizes the imposition of a
 16  9 local sales and services tax at a rate of not more than 1
 16 10 percent. The bill requires a local sales and services tax, if
 16 11 imposed, to be 1 percent.
 16 12    The bill provides that the imposition of local option
 16 13 taxes in effect on the effective date of the bill shall not
 16 14 be affected by the bill, and such taxes shall continue to
 16 15 be imposed until their repeal pursuant to Code chapter 423B.
 16 16  The law in effect regarding repeal at the time of the repeal
 16 17 governs the repeal of the local option taxes.
       LSB 1760HV (1) 87
       md/sc
 14  5    Sec. 19.  IMPLEMENTATION.  This Act shall not affect the
 14  6 imposition of local option taxes in effect on the effective
 14  7 date of this Act and such taxes shall continue to be imposed
 14  8 until their repeal pursuant to chapter 423B.  The law regarding
 14  9 repeal in effect at the time of the repeal governs the repeal
 14 10 of the local option taxes.
 14 11                           EXPLANATION
 14 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 14    This bill relates to the approval and imposition of the
 14 15 local option sales and services tax.  Current Code chapter 423B
 14 16 authorizes the imposition of local option taxes, including
 14 17 a local option sales and services tax. Currently, such a
 14 18 proposed tax is only presented to the voters of a whole county
 14 19 upon the filing of a petition signed by eligible electors of
 14 20 the county equal in number to 5 percent of the persons in
 14 21 the county who voted at the last preceding general election
 14 22 or upon receipt by the county commissioner of elections of
 14 23 motions requesting such submission, adopted by the governing
 14 24 bodies of the cities located within the county or the governing
 14 25 body of the county for the unincorporated area of the county,
 14 26 representing at least one=half of the population of the county.
 14 27    The bill amends the methods of seeking presentment of the
 14 28 local option sales and services tax to the voters of certain
 14 29 qualified counties by allowing the eligible electors of
 14 30 individual cities and the unincorporated area of a county to
 14 31 file a petition for an election to be held in the petitioning
 14 32 jurisdiction if such petition is signed by eligible electors
 14 33 of the city or the unincorporated area of the county, as
 14 34 applicable, equal in number to 5 percent of the persons in
 14 35 the applicable city or unincorporated area of the county who
 15  1 voted at the last preceding general election.  The bill defines
 15  2 "qualified county" to mean a county with a population in excess
 15  3 of 400,000, a county with a population of at least 130,000 but
 15  4 not more than 131,000, or a county with a population of at
 15  5 least 60,000 but not more than 70,000, according to the 2010
 15  6 federal decennial census. For those qualified counties, the
 15  7 bill also removes the requirement that in order to have the
 15  8 local sales and services tax presented to the voters, motions
 15  9 must be approved by cities or the county for the unincorporated
 15 10 area, representing at least one=half of the county's
 15 11 population. Instead, the bill allows individual cities or the
 15 12 county for the unincorporated area within a qualified county
 15 13 to approve a motion for an election on the local sales and
 15 14 services tax to be held in only that jurisdiction.
 15 15    The bill specifies that except for purposes of allocating
 15 16 local sales and services tax receipts based on the county in
 15 17 which the tax was collected, a city shall be deemed to be
 15 18 located in a qualified county if a majority of the population
 15 19 of the city, according to the 2010 federal decennial census,
 15 20 resides in the qualified county.
 15 21    The bill provides that in a qualified county a city or the
 15 22 board of supervisors for the unincorporated area of a county
 15 23 may repeal the local sales and services tax in the city upon
 15 24 adoption of its own motion for repeal.
 15 25    For those counties that are not qualified counties, the
 15 26 methods of seeking presentment of the local option sales and
 15 27 services tax to the voters and the methods for repealing such
 15 28 a tax remain the same as required under current Code chapter
 15 29 423B.
 15 30    The bill provides that each city or county for which the
 15 31 imposition of the local sales and services tax was approved at
 15 32 election on or after the effective date of the bill shall use
 15 33 not less than 50 percent of the moneys received for property
 15 34 tax relief.
 15 35    The bill strikes special provisions related to the approval
 16  1 and imposition of a local sales and services tax in a city that
 16  2 is located in two or more contiguous counties.
 16  3    The bill provides that a local sales and services tax is
 16  4 not applicable to transactions of a retailer holding a retail
 16  5 sales tax permit at a place of business if the retailer's place
 16  6 of business is located in part within a city or unincorporated
 16  7 area of the county where the tax is not imposed.
 16  8    Current Code chapter 423B authorizes the imposition of a
 16  9 local sales and services tax at a rate of not more than 1
 16 10 percent. The bill requires a local sales and services tax, if
 16 11 imposed, to be 1 percent.
 16 12    The bill provides that the imposition of local option
 16 13 taxes in effect on the effective date of the bill shall not
 16 14 be affected by the bill, and such taxes shall continue to
 16 15 be imposed until their repeal pursuant to Code chapter 423B.

 14 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 14    This bill relates to the approval and imposition of the
 14 15 local option sales and services tax.  Current Code chapter 423B
 14 16 authorizes the imposition of local option taxes, including
 14 17 a local option sales and services tax. Currently, such a
 14 18 proposed tax is only presented to the voters of a whole county
 14 19 upon the filing of a petition signed by eligible electors of
 14 20 the county equal in number to 5 percent of the persons in
 14 21 the county who voted at the last preceding general election
 14 22 or upon receipt by the county commissioner of elections of

 14 24 bodies of the cities located within the county or the governing
 14 25 body of the county for the unincorporated area of the county,
 14 26 representing at least one=half of the population of the county.
 14 27    The bill amends the methods of seeking presentment of the
 14 28 local option sales and services tax to the voters of certain
 14 29 qualified counties by allowing the eligible electors of
 14 30 individual cities and the unincorporated area of a county to
 14 31 file a petition for an election to be held in the petitioning
 14 32 jurisdiction if such petition is signed by eligible electors
 14 33 of the city or the unincorporated area of the county, as
 14 34 applicable, equal in number to 5 percent of the persons in
 14 35 the applicable city or unincorporated area of the county who
 15  1 voted at the last preceding general election.  The bill defines
 15  2 "qualified county" to mean a county with a population in excess
 15  3 of 400,000, a county with a population of at least 130,000 but
 15  4 not more than 131,000, or a county with a population of at
 15  5 least 60,000 but not more than 70,000, according to the 2010
 15  6 federal decennial census. For those qualified counties, the
 15  7 bill also removes the requirement that in order to have the
 15  8 local sales and services tax presented to the voters, motions
 15  9 must be approved by cities or the county for the unincorporated
 15 10 area, representing at least one=half of the county's
 15 11 population. Instead, the bill allows individual cities or the
 15 12 county for the unincorporated area within a qualified county
 15 13 to approve a motion for an election on the local sales and
 15 14 services tax to be held in only that jurisdiction.
 15 15    The bill specifies that except for purposes of allocating
 15 16 local sales and services tax receipts based on the county in
 15 17 which the tax was collected, a city shall be deemed to be
 15 18 located in a qualified county if a majority of the population
 15 19 of the city, according to the 2010 federal decennial census,
 15 20 resides in the qualified county.
 15 21    The bill provides that in a qualified county a city or the
 15 22 board of supervisors for the unincorporated area of a county
 15 23 may repeal the local sales and services tax in the city upon
 15 24 adoption of its own motion for repeal.
 15 25    For those counties that are not qualified counties, the
 15 26 methods of seeking presentment of the local option sales and
 15 27 services tax to the voters and the methods for repealing such
 15 28 a tax remain the same as required under current Code chapter
 15 29 423B.
 15 30    The bill provides that each city or county for which the
 15 31 imposition of the local sales and services tax was approved at
 15 32 election on or after the effective date of the bill shall use
 15 33 not less than 50 percent of the moneys received for property
 15 34 tax relief.
 15 35    The bill strikes special provisions related to the approval
 16  1 and imposition of a local sales and services tax in a city that

 16  3    The bill provides that a local sales and services tax is
 16  4 not applicable to transactions of a retailer holding a retail
 16  5 sales tax permit at a place of business if the retailer's place
 16  6 of business is located in part within a city or unincorporated
 16  7 area of the county where the tax is not imposed.
 16  8    Current Code chapter 423B authorizes the imposition of a

 14 11                           EXPLANATION
 14 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 14    This bill relates to the approval and imposition of the
 14 15 local option sales and services tax.  Current Code chapter 423B
 14 16 authorizes the imposition of local option taxes, including
 14 17 a local option sales and services tax. Currently, such a
 14 18 proposed tax is only presented to the voters of a whole county
 14 19 upon the filing of a petition signed by eligible electors of
 14 20 the county equal in number to 5 percent of the persons in
 14 21 the county who voted at the last preceding general election
 14 22 or upon receipt by the county commissioner of elections of
 14 23 motions requesting such submission, adopted by the governing
 14 24 bodies of the cities located within the county or the governing
 14 25 body of the county for the unincorporated area of the county,
 14 26 representing at least one=half of the population of the county.
 14 27    The bill amends the methods of seeking presentment of the
 14 28 local option sales and services tax to the voters of certain
 14 29 qualified counties by allowing the eligible electors of
 14 30 individual cities and the unincorporated area of a county to
 14 31 file a petition for an election to be held in the petitioning
 14 32 jurisdiction if such petition is signed by eligible electors
 14 33 of the city or the unincorporated area of the county, as
 14 34 applicable, equal in number to 5 percent of the persons in
 14 35 the applicable city or unincorporated area of the county who
 15  1 voted at the last preceding general election.  The bill defines
 15  2 "qualified county" to mean a county with a population in excess
 15  3 of 400,000, a county with a population of at least 130,000 but
 15  4 not more than 131,000, or a county with a population of at
 15  5 least 60,000 but not more than 70,000, according to the 2010
 15  6 federal decennial census. For those qualified counties, the
 15  7 bill also removes the requirement that in order to have the
 15  8 local sales and services tax presented to the voters, motions
 15  9 must be approved by cities or the county for the unincorporated
 15 10 area, representing at least one=half of the county's
 15 11 population. Instead, the bill allows individual cities or the
 15 12 county for the unincorporated area within a qualified county
 15 13 to approve a motion for an election on the local sales and
 15 14 services tax to be held in only that jurisdiction.
 15 15    The bill specifies that except for purposes of allocating
 15 16 local sales and services tax receipts based on the county in
 15 17 which the tax was collected, a city shall be deemed to be
 15 18 located in a qualified county if a majority of the population
 15 19 of the city, according to the 2010 federal decennial census,
 15 20 resides in the qualified county.
 15 21    The bill provides that in a qualified county a city or the
 15 22 board of supervisors for the unincorporated area of a county
 15 23 may repeal the local sales and services tax in the city upon
 15 24 adoption of its own motion for repeal.
 15 25    For those counties that are not qualified counties, the
 15 26 methods of seeking presentment of the local option sales and
 15 27 services tax to the voters and the methods for repealing such
 15 28 a tax remain the same as required under current Code chapter
 15 29 423B.
 15 30    The bill provides that each city or county for which the
 15 31 imposition of the local sales and services tax was approved at
 15 32 election on or after the effective date of the bill shall use
 15 33 not less than 50 percent of the moneys received for property
 15 34 tax relief.
 15 35    The bill strikes special provisions related to the approval
 16  1 and imposition of a local sales and services tax in a city that
 16  2 is located in two or more contiguous counties.
 16  3    The bill provides that a local sales and services tax is
 16  4 not applicable to transactions of a retailer holding a retail
 16  5 sales tax permit at a place of business if the retailer's place
 16  6 of business is located in part within a city or unincorporated
 16  7 area of the county where the tax is not imposed.
 16  8    Current Code chapter 423B authorizes the imposition of a
 16  9 local sales and services tax at a rate of not more than 1
 16 10 percent. The bill requires a local sales and services tax, if
 16 11 imposed, to be 1 percent.
 16 12    The bill provides that the imposition of local option
 16 13 taxes in effect on the effective date of the bill shall not
 16 14 be affected by the bill, and such taxes shall continue to
 16 15 be imposed until their repeal pursuant to Code chapter 423B.

 14 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 14    This bill relates to the approval and imposition of the
 14 15 local option sales and services tax.  Current Code chapter 423B
 14 16 authorizes the imposition of local option taxes, including
 14 17 a local option sales and services tax. Currently, such a
 14 18 proposed tax is only presented to the voters of a whole county
 14 19 upon the filing of a petition signed by eligible electors of
 14 20 the county equal in number to 5 percent of the persons in
 14 21 the county who voted at the last preceding general election
 14 22 or upon receipt by the county commissioner of elections of

 14 24 bodies of the cities located within the county or the governing
 14 25 body of the county for the unincorporated area of the county,
 14 26 representing at least one=half of the population of the county.
 14 27    The bill amends the methods of seeking presentment of the
 14 28 local option sales and services tax to the voters of certain
 14 29 qualified counties by allowing the eligible electors of
 14 30 individual cities and the unincorporated area of a county to
 14 31 file a petition for an election to be held in the petitioning
 14 32 jurisdiction if such petition is signed by eligible electors
 14 33 of the city or the unincorporated area of the county, as
 14 34 applicable, equal in number to 5 percent of the persons in
 14 35 the applicable city or unincorporated area of the county who
 15  1 voted at the last preceding general election.  The bill defines
 15  2 "qualified county" to mean a county with a population in excess
 15  3 of 400,000, a county with a population of at least 130,000 but
 15  4 not more than 131,000, or a county with a population of at
 15  5 least 60,000 but not more than 70,000, according to the 2010
 15  6 federal decennial census. For those qualified counties, the
 15  7 bill also removes the requirement that in order to have the
 15  8 local sales and services tax presented to the voters, motions
 15  9 must be approved by cities or the county for the unincorporated
 15 10 area, representing at least one=half of the county's
 15 11 population. Instead, the bill allows individual cities or the
 15 12 county for the unincorporated area within a qualified county
 15 13 to approve a motion for an election on the local sales and
 15 14 services tax to be held in only that jurisdiction.
 15 15    The bill specifies that except for purposes of allocating
 15 16 local sales and services tax receipts based on the county in
 15 17 which the tax was collected, a city shall be deemed to be
 15 18 located in a qualified county if a majority of the population
 15 19 of the city, according to the 2010 federal decennial census,
 15 20 resides in the qualified county.
 15 21    The bill provides that in a qualified county a city or the
 15 22 board of supervisors for the unincorporated area of a county
 15 23 may repeal the local sales and services tax in the city upon
 15 24 adoption of its own motion for repeal.
 15 25    For those counties that are not qualified counties, the
 15 26 methods of seeking presentment of the local option sales and
 15 27 services tax to the voters and the methods for repealing such
 15 28 a tax remain the same as required under current Code chapter
 15 29 423B.
 15 30    The bill provides that each city or county for which the
 15 31 imposition of the local sales and services tax was approved at
 15 32 election on or after the effective date of the bill shall use
 15 33 not less than 50 percent of the moneys received for property
 15 34 tax relief.
 15 35    The bill strikes special provisions related to the approval
 16  1 and imposition of a local sales and services tax in a city that

 16  3    The bill provides that a local sales and services tax is

 16  5 sales tax permit at a place of business if the retailer's place
 16  6 of business is located in part within a city or unincorporated

 16  8    Current Code chapter 423B authorizes the imposition of a

 14 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 14    This bill relates to the approval and imposition of the
 14 15 local option sales and services tax.  Current Code chapter 423B
 14 16 authorizes the imposition of local option taxes, including
 14 17 a local option sales and services tax. Currently, such a
 14 18 proposed tax is only presented to the voters of a whole county
 14 19 upon the filing of a petition signed by eligible electors of
 14 20 the county equal in number to 5 percent of the persons in
 14 21 the county who voted at the last preceding general election
 14 22 or upon receipt by the county commissioner of elections of
 14 23 motions requesting such submission, adopted by the governing
 14 24 bodies of the cities located within the county or the governing
 14 25 body of the county for the unincorporated area of the county,
 14 26 representing at least one=half of the population of the county.
 14 27    The bill amends the methods of seeking presentment of the
 14 28 local option sales and services tax to the voters of certain
 14 29 qualified counties by allowing the eligible electors of
 14 30 individual cities and the unincorporated area of a county to
 14 31 file a petition for an election to be held in the petitioning
 14 32 jurisdiction if such petition is signed by eligible electors
 14 33 of the city or the unincorporated area of the county, as
 14 34 applicable, equal in number to 5 percent of the persons in
 14 35 the applicable city or unincorporated area of the county who
 15  1 voted at the last preceding general election.  The bill defines
 15  2 "qualified county" to mean a county with a population in excess
 15  3 of 400,000, a county with a population of at least 130,000 but
 15  4 not more than 131,000, or a county with a population of at
 15  5 least 60,000 but not more than 70,000, according to the 2010
 15  6 federal decennial census. For those qualified counties, the
 15  7 bill also removes the requirement that in order to have the
 15  8 local sales and services tax presented to the voters, motions
 15  9 must be approved by cities or the county for the unincorporated
 15 10 area, representing at least one=half of the county's
 15 11 population. Instead, the bill allows individual cities or the
 15 12 county for the unincorporated area within a qualified county
 15 13 to approve a motion for an election on the local sales and
 15 14 services tax to be held in only that jurisdiction.
 15 15    The bill specifies that except for purposes of allocating
 15 16 local sales and services tax receipts based on the county in
 15 17 which the tax was collected, a city shall be deemed to be
 15 18 located in a qualified county if a majority of the population
 15 19 of the city, according to the 2010 federal decennial census,
 15 20 resides in the qualified county.
 15 21    The bill provides that in a qualified county a city or the
 15 22 board of supervisors for the unincorporated area of a county
 15 23 may repeal the local sales and services tax in the city upon
 15 24 adoption of its own motion for repeal.
 15 25    For those counties that are not qualified counties, the
 15 26 methods of seeking presentment of the local option sales and
 15 27 services tax to the voters and the methods for repealing such
 15 28 a tax remain the same as required under current Code chapter
 15 29 423B.
 15 30    The bill provides that each city or county for which the
 15 31 imposition of the local sales and services tax was approved at
 15 32 election on or after the effective date of the bill shall use
 15 33 not less than 50 percent of the moneys received for property
 15 34 tax relief.
 15 35    The bill strikes special provisions related to the approval
 16  1 and imposition of a local sales and services tax in a city that
 16  2 is located in two or more contiguous counties.
 16  3    The bill provides that a local sales and services tax is
 16  4 not applicable to transactions of a retailer holding a retail
 16  5 sales tax permit at a place of business if the retailer's place
 16  6 of business is located in part within a city or unincorporated

 16  8    Current Code chapter 423B authorizes the imposition of a
 16  9 local sales and services tax at a rate of not more than 1
 16 10 percent. The bill requires a local sales and services tax, if
 16 11 imposed, to be 1 percent.
 16 12    The bill provides that the imposition of local option

 14 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 14    This bill relates to the approval and imposition of the
 14 15 local option sales and services tax.  Current Code chapter 423B
 14 16 authorizes the imposition of local option taxes, including
 14 17 a local option sales and services tax. Currently, such a
 14 18 proposed tax is only presented to the voters of a whole county
 14 19 upon the filing of a petition signed by eligible electors of
 14 20 the county equal in number to 5 percent of the persons in
 14 21 the county who voted at the last preceding general election
 14 22 or upon receipt by the county commissioner of elections of
 14 23 motions requesting such submission, adopted by the governing
 14 24 bodies of the cities located within the county or the governing
 14 25 body of the county for the unincorporated area of the county,
 14 26 representing at least one=half of the population of the county.
 14 27    The bill amends the methods of seeking presentment of the
 14 28 local option sales and services tax to the voters of certain
 14 29 qualified counties by allowing the eligible electors of
 14 30 individual cities and the unincorporated area of a county to
 14 31 file a petition for an election to be held in the petitioning
 14 32 jurisdiction if such petition is signed by eligible electors
 14 33 of the city or the unincorporated area of the county, as
 14 34 applicable, equal in number to 5 percent of the persons in
 14 35 the applicable city or unincorporated area of the county who
 15  1 voted at the last preceding general election.  The bill defines
 15  2 "qualified county" to mean a county with a population in excess
 15  3 of 400,000, a county with a population of at least 130,000 but
 15  4 not more than 131,000, or a county with a population of at
 15  5 least 60,000 but not more than 70,000, according to the 2010
 15  6 federal decennial census. For those qualified counties, the
 15  7 bill also removes the requirement that in order to have the
 15  8 local sales and services tax presented to the voters, motions
 15  9 must be approved by cities or the county for the unincorporated
 15 10 area, representing at least one=half of the county's
 15 11 population. Instead, the bill allows individual cities or the
 15 12 county for the unincorporated area within a qualified county
 15 13 to approve a motion for an election on the local sales and
 15 14 services tax to be held in only that jurisdiction.
 15 15    The bill specifies that except for purposes of allocating
 15 16 local sales and services tax receipts based on the county in
 15 17 which the tax was collected, a city shall be deemed to be
 15 18 located in a qualified county if a majority of the population
 15 19 of the city, according to the 2010 federal decennial census,
 15 20 resides in the qualified county.
 15 21    The bill provides that in a qualified county a city or the
 15 22 board of supervisors for the unincorporated area of a county
 15 23 may repeal the local sales and services tax in the city upon
 15 24 adoption of its own motion for repeal.
 15 25    For those counties that are not qualified counties, the
 15 26 methods of seeking presentment of the local option sales and
 15 27 services tax to the voters and the methods for repealing such
 15 28 a tax remain the same as required under current Code chapter
 15 29 423B.
 15 30    The bill provides that each city or county for which the
 15 31 imposition of the local sales and services tax was approved at
 15 32 election on or after the effective date of the bill shall use
 15 33 not less than 50 percent of the moneys received for property
 15 34 tax relief.
 15 35    The bill strikes special provisions related to the approval
 16  1 and imposition of a local sales and services tax in a city that
 16  2 is located in two or more contiguous counties.
 16  3    The bill provides that a local sales and services tax is
 16  4 not applicable to transactions of a retailer holding a retail
 16  5 sales tax permit at a place of business if the retailer's place
 16  6 of business is located in part within a city or unincorporated
 16  7 area of the county where the tax is not imposed.
 16  8    Current Code chapter 423B authorizes the imposition of a
 16  9 local sales and services tax at a rate of not more than 1
 16 10 percent. The bill requires a local sales and services tax, if
 16 11 imposed, to be 1 percent.
 16 12    The bill provides that the imposition of local option
 16 13 taxes in effect on the effective date of the bill shall not
 16 14 be affected by the bill, and such taxes shall continue to
 16 15 be imposed until their repeal pursuant to Code chapter 423B.
 16 16  The law in effect regarding repeal at the time of the repeal
 16 17 governs the repeal of the local option taxes.
