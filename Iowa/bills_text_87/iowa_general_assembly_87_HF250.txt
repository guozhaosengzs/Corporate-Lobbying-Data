  5 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 15    This bill provides for an adjustment in the assessed value of
  5 16 a homestead, as defined in the bill, if the owner is a person
  5 17 who is 65 or older and who has household income of less than
  5 18 $30,000 per year. If the qualifications established in the
  5 19 bill are met, the assessed value of the homestead upon which
  5 20 property taxes are levied in a fiscal year is the same assessed
  5 21 value as for the previous fiscal year.  The bill specifies that
  5 22 the assessed value is that value prior to any rollback being
  5 23 applied.
  5 24    The bill further provides that if the amount of property
  5 25 taxes levied against the adjusted assessment exceeds the amount
  5 26 of property taxes levied against the property in the fiscal
  5 27 year for which taxes were first levied against an adjusted
  5 28 assessment under the bill, the county treasurer is required to
  5 29 subtract such difference from the amount due. The adjustments
  5 30 to assessed value and to the amount of property taxes levied
  5 31 under the bill shall not be construed to be exemptions or
  5 32 credits within the meaning of Code section 25B.7.
  5 33    The bill provides that a person who makes a false affidavit
  5 34 for the purpose of obtaining an adjustment, knowingly receives
  5 35 the adjustment without being legally entitled to it, or makes
  6  1 claim for the adjustment in more than one county without being
  6  2 legally entitled to it is guilty of a fraudulent practice and
  6  3 is subject to a criminal penalty.
