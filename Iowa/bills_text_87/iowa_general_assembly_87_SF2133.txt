  8 17 paid to employees as determined by the department pursuant to

  9 27 in employment with a covered employer a premium rate of
  9 28 four=tenths of one percent of an employee's wages based on the

  9 31 to one=third of the total premium rate.
  9 32    b.  The premium rate for medical leave benefits shall be

 10  6 up to forty=five percent of the full amount of the required
 10  7 premiums from the wages of each employee. The remaining
 10  8 fifty=five percent of the required premiums shall be paid by
 10  9 the covered employer.
 10 10    4.  For medical leave premiums a covered employer may deduct
 10 11 up to forty=five percent of the full amount of the required

 10 14 the covered employer.

 10 16 the employee's share of the premiums for family leave benefits
 10 17 or medical leave benefits or both.
 10 18    6.  The director shall annually set a maximum limit on the
 10 19 amount of an employee's wages that are subject to a premium
 10 20 assessment under this section that is equal to the contribution
 10 21 and benefit base for the calendar year as determined by the
 10 22 United States social security administration for purposes of
 10 23 26 U.S.C. {3121(a).
 10 24    7.  For calendar year 2023 and subsequent calendar years,
 10 25 the total premium rate shall be based on the family leave and
 10 26 medical leave insurance account balance ratio as of September
 10 27 30 of the previous year. The director shall calculate the
 10 28 account balance ratio by dividing the balance of the family
 10 29 leave and medical leave insurance account by the total wages
 10 30 paid by covered employers. The division shall be carried
 10 31 to the fourth decimal place with the remaining fraction
 10 32 disregarded unless it amounts to five hundred thousandths or
 10 33 more in which case the fourth decimal place shall be rounded
 10 34 to the next higher digit. If the family leave and medical
 10 35 leave insurance account balance ratio is any of the following
 11  1 percentages, the premium shall be the following percentage of
 11  2 an employee's wages subject to a premium assessment:
 11  3    a.  If the ratio is zero to nine hundredths of one percent,
 11  4 the premium shall be six=tenths of one percent.
 11  5    b.  If the ratio is one=tenth of one percent to nineteen
 11  6 hundredths of one  percent, the premium shall be five=tenths of
 11  7 one percent.
 11  8    c.  If the ratio is two=tenths of one percent to twenty=nine
 11  9 hundredths of one percent, the premium shall be four=tenths of
 11 10 one percent.
 11 11    d.  If the ratio is three=tenths of one percent to
 11 12 thirty=nine hundredths of one percent, the premium shall be
 11 13 three=tenths of one percent.
 11 14    e.  If the ratio is four=tenths of one percent to forty=nine
 11 15 hundredths of one percent, the premium shall be two=tenths of
 11 16 one percent.
 11 17    f.  If the ratio is five=tenths of one percent or greater,
 11 18 the premium shall be one=tenth of one percent.
 11 19    8.  Beginning January 1, 2023, if the account balance ratio
 11 20 calculated in subsection 7 is below five hundredths of one
 11 21 percent, the director shall assess a solvency surcharge at
 11 22 the lowest rate necessary to provide revenue to pay for the
 11 23 administrative and benefit costs of family leave and medical
 11 24 leave insurance for the calendar year. The solvency surcharge
 11 25 shall be at least one=tenth of one percent and no more than
 11 26 six=tenths of one percent and shall be added to the total
 11 27 premium rate assessed to each employee of a covered employer
 11 28 for family leave and medical leave benefits.
 11 29    9.  A covered employer shall collect all required premiums
 11 30 and surcharges from the employer's employees through payroll
 11 31 deductions and shall remit the amount collected and the amount
 11 32 to be paid by the employer to the department as required by
 11 33 rules adopted by the director.
 11 34    10.  On September 30 of each year the department shall
 11 35 average the number of employees reported by an employer over
 12  1 the last four completed calendar quarters to determine the
 12  2 number of employees employed by the employer for the purpose
 12  3 of determining if an employer shall be considered a covered
 12  4 employer for the next calendar year.
 12  5    Sec. 13.    9 25    1.  Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending December

  9 33 equal to two=thirds of the total premium rate.
  9 34    2.  For calendar year 2023 and subsequent calendar years the

 10  1 to family leave benefits and the percentage of paid claims
 10  2 related to medical leave benefits and adjust the premium rates
 10  3 set in subsection 1 by the proportional share of claims paid
 10  4 for both types of leave.
 10  5    3.  For family leave premiums a covered employer may deduct
 10  6 up to forty=five percent of the full amount of the required
 10  7 premiums from the wages of each employee. The remaining

 18 25 AND MEDICAL LEAVE INSURANCE PROGRAM AND REPORT TO THE GENERAL
 18 26 ASSEMBLY.  The director of the department of workforce
 18 27 development shall conduct an analysis of the family leave
 18 28 and medical leave insurance program as funded pursuant to
 18 29 section 96A.12, as enacted in this Act, and of the benefits
 18 30 paid pursuant to section 96A.10, as enacted in this Act. The
 18 31 director shall determine if the premium rates and benefit
 18 32 levels are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency
 18 33 of the family leave and medical leave insurance account.
 18 34    The director shall submit the director's findings to the
 18 35 general assembly pursuant to section 7A.11 no later than
 19  1 January 14, 2019.
 19  2                           EXPLANATION
 19  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  5    This bill relates to a family leave and medical leave
 19  6 insurance program, administered by the director of the
 19  7 department of workforce development, that provides for paid,
 19  8 job protected leave for certain family leave and medical leave
 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 18 29 section 96A.12, as enacted in this Act, and of the benefits
 18 30 paid pursuant to section 96A.10, as enacted in this Act. The

 18 32 levels are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency
 18 33 of the family leave and medical leave insurance account.
 18 34    The director shall submit the director's findings to the

 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member

 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the

 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health

 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or

 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the

 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium

 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 18 26 ASSEMBLY.  The director of the department of workforce
 18 27 development shall conduct an analysis of the family leave
 18 28 and medical leave insurance program as funded pursuant to
 18 29 section 96A.12, as enacted in this Act, and of the benefits
 18 30 paid pursuant to section 96A.10, as enacted in this Act. The
 18 31 director shall determine if the premium rates and benefit
 18 32 levels are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency
 18 33 of the family leave and medical leave insurance account.
 18 34    The director shall submit the director's findings to the
 18 35 general assembly pursuant to section 7A.11 no later than
 19  1 January 14, 2019.
 19  2                           EXPLANATION
 19  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  5    This bill relates to a family leave and medical leave
 19  6 insurance program, administered by the director of the
 19  7 department of workforce development, that provides for paid,
 19  8 job protected leave for certain family leave and medical leave
 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim

 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's

 19  8 job protected leave for certain family leave and medical leave
 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an

 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent

 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average

 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed

 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 18 29 section 96A.12, as enacted in this Act, and of the benefits
 18 30 paid pursuant to section 96A.10, as enacted in this Act. The
 18 31 director shall determine if the premium rates and benefit
 18 32 levels are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency
 18 33 of the family leave and medical leave insurance account.
 18 34    The director shall submit the director's findings to the

 19  2                           EXPLANATION
 19  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  5    This bill relates to a family leave and medical leave
 19  6 insurance program, administered by the director of the
 19  7 department of workforce development, that provides for paid,
 19  8 job protected leave for certain family leave and medical leave
 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim

 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.

 19  7 department of workforce development, that provides for paid,
 19  8 job protected leave for certain family leave and medical leave
 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or

 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim

 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's

 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 19  2                           EXPLANATION
 19  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  5    This bill relates to a family leave and medical leave
 19  6 insurance program, administered by the director of the
 19  7 department of workforce development, that provides for paid,
 19  8 job protected leave for certain family leave and medical leave
 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim

 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.

 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.

 19  7 department of workforce development, that provides for paid,
 19  8 job protected leave for certain family leave and medical leave
 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an

 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an

 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 19  2                           EXPLANATION
 19  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  5    This bill relates to a family leave and medical leave
 19  6 insurance program, administered by the director of the
 19  7 department of workforce development, that provides for paid,
 19  8 job protected leave for certain family leave and medical leave
 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that

 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an

 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 18 34    The director shall submit the director's findings to the
 18 35 general assembly pursuant to section 7A.11 no later than
 19  1 January 14, 2019.
 19  2                           EXPLANATION
 19  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  5    This bill relates to a family leave and medical leave
 19  6 insurance program, administered by the director of the
 19  7 department of workforce development, that provides for paid,
 19  8 job protected leave for certain family leave and medical leave
 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an

 22 24 as required by the director.

 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month

 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of

 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit

 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 19  2                           EXPLANATION
 19  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  5    This bill relates to a family leave and medical leave
 19  6 insurance program, administered by the director of the
 19  7 department of workforce development, that provides for paid,
 19  8 job protected leave for certain family leave and medical leave
 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not

 19  2                           EXPLANATION
 19  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  5    This bill relates to a family leave and medical leave
 19  6 insurance program, administered by the director of the
 19  7 department of workforce development, that provides for paid,
 19  8 job protected leave for certain family leave and medical leave
 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 19  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  5    This bill relates to a family leave and medical leave
 19  6 insurance program, administered by the director of the
 19  7 department of workforce development, that provides for paid,
 19  8 job protected leave for certain family leave and medical leave
 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that

 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee

 19  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19  5    This bill relates to a family leave and medical leave
 19  6 insurance program, administered by the director of the
 19  7 department of workforce development, that provides for paid,
 19  8 job protected leave for certain family leave and medical leave
 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee

 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 19  5    This bill relates to a family leave and medical leave
 19  6 insurance program, administered by the director of the
 19  7 department of workforce development, that provides for paid,
 19  8 job protected leave for certain family leave and medical leave
 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open

 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide

 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A

 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 19  7 department of workforce development, that provides for paid,
 19  8 job protected leave for certain family leave and medical leave
 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.

 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee

 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an

 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care

 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average

 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed

 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 19  9 reasons for eligible employees of specified employers.
 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the

 19 10    An employee is eligible for family leave and medical leave
 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care

 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's

 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 19 11 after working for a covered employer, as defined in the bill,
 19 12 for a minimum of 12 consecutive months and a minimum of 1,250
 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or

 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's

 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 19 13 hours during the 12 consecutive=month period immediately
 19 14 preceding the employee's request for leave. Family leave and
 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim

 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department

 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement

 19 15 medical leave are defined in the bill. Family leave includes
 19 16 leave to care for an immediate family member with a serious
 19 17 health condition, to bond with a newborn child or adopted or
 19 18 foster child, or for a qualifying exigency for a family member
 19 19 as permitted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act
 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department

 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month

 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 19 20 of 1993, as amended. Medical leave includes leave due to
 19 21 the employee's own serious health condition. Serious health
 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly

 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent

 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or

 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the

 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined

 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family

 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent

 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's

 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending

 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 19 22 condition is defined in the bill.
 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim

 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director

 19 23    The bill provides that an eligible employee may not receive
 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month

 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 19 24 more than 12 weeks of family leave, 12 weeks of medical leave,
 19 25 or 16 weeks of combined family and medical leave in a defined
 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee

 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.

 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide

 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the

 19 26 consecutive 12=month period. The defined consecutive 12=month
 19 27 period begins on the date of the birth of a child or placement
 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly

 19 28 of a child for adoption or foster care with an eligible
 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an

 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care

 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The

 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through

 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a

 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive

 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee

 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 19 29 employee, or on the first date that an eligible employee takes
 19 30 either family leave or medical leave.  The minimum duration of
 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the

 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels

 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through

 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a

 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.

 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 19 31 leave an eligible employee may take is eight consecutive hours.
 19 32    An employee is disqualified for family leave and medical
 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall

 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide

 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.

 19 33 leave benefits for an absence due to the employee purposefully
 19 34 causing injury or sickness to the employee or a family member,
 19 35 for an absence caused by an illness or injury due to the
 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent

 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an

 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues

 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave

 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from

 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer

 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 20  1 employee engaging in an illegal act, or an absence due to an
 20  2 employer taking disciplinary action against the employee.
 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a

 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that

 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A

 20  3    An employee must provide a minimum of 30 days' notice to an
 20  4 employer of the employee's intent to take leave for the birth
 20  5 of a child or placement of a child for adoption or foster care
 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly

 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the

 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The

 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's

 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a

 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open

 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.

 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the

 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department

 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 20  6 with the employee, or of the employee's intent to take family
 20  7 leave or medical leave. If circumstances necessitate that an
 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a

 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that

 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family

 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave

 20  8 employee's leave begins in less than 30 days the employee must
 20  9 give as much notice as is practicable.  If an eligible employee
 20 10 requests medical leave or family leave, the employee must make
 20 11 a reasonable effort to schedule their own medical treatment, or
 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly

 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly

 20 12 their family member's medical treatment, to not unduly disrupt
 20 13 the employer's operations.
 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically

 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and

 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee

 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave

 20 14    The bill requires an eligible employee to file a claim
 20 15 for benefits as required by the director. The employee
 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly

 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive

 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the

 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of

 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A

 20 16 must consent to the disclosure of potentially private or
 20 17 confidential information to and from the department and the
 20 18 employee's employer for the administration of the family leave
 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not

 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 20 19 or medical leave. The bill specifies that such information
 20 20 is not a public record pursuant to Code section 22.1. The
 20 21 employee must attest that the employee has provided notice
 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one

 20 22 of the employee's intent to take leave to the employee's
 20 23 employer. The employee must also authorize the employee's
 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly

 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the

 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the

 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly

 20 24 health care provider, or the employee's family member's health
 20 25 care provider, to complete a certification of a serious health
 20 26 condition as required by the director.
 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.

 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels

 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 20 27    The bill provides for a seven=day waiting period before
 20 28 benefits are payable. There is no waiting period for leave for
 20 29 the birth of a child or placement of a child for adoption or
 20 30 foster care.
 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that

 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly

 20 31    The basis for the calculation of the amount of a family
 20 32 leave or medical leave benefit is an eligible employee's weekly
 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that

 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide

 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave

 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly

 20 33 earnings as defined in the bill. The weekly leave benefit
 20 34 amount payable to an employee for any one week is 80 percent
 20 35 of the employee's weekly spendable earnings, but shall not
 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a

 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.

 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly

 21  1 exceed an amount equal to 200 percent of the statewide average
 21  2 weekly wage paid to employees as determined by the department
 21  3 of workforce development pursuant to Code section 96.19. The
 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for

 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee

 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide

 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.

 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly

 21  4 minimum weekly leave benefit amount shall be equal to the
 21  5 weekly leave benefit amount of a person whose gross weekly
 21  6 earnings are 35 percent of the statewide average weekly wage,
 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee

 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the

 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly

 21  7 or to the spendable weekly earnings of the employee, whichever
 21  8 is less. "Spendable weekly earnings" is defined in the bill as
 21  9 the amount remaining after payroll taxes are deducted from an
 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee

 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave

 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 21 10 employee's gross weekly earnings.
 21 11    The department shall send the first benefit payment to an
 21 12 eligible employee within 10 days after a properly completed
 21 13 weekly claim for benefits is completed by the employee
 21 14 and received by the department. If the employee continues
 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the

 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the

 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels

 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly

 21 15 to submit a properly completed weekly claim, subsequent
 21 16 payments are to be made to the employee at least biweekly.
 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to

 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee

 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a

 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive

 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 21 17 If an employer, or the department, contests an employee's
 21 18 eligibility, benefit payments may be made on a conditional
 21 19 basis. The employee is required to pay the benefits back if
 21 20 the department later rules that the employee is ineligible to
 21 21 receive such benefits.
 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open

 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical

 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of

 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide

 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A

 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the

 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a

 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family
 24  8 leave and medical leave insurance program and to  provide
 24  9 outreach to ensure that employers and employees are aware of
 24 10 the program and the benefits available under such.
 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the
 24 23 family leave and medical leave insurance program.
 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly
 24 31 no later than January 14, 2019.

 21 22    The bill provides that the family leave and medical leave
 21 23 insurance program shall be funded via employee and employer
 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and

 21 24 contributions. Beginning on January 1, 2021, and ending
 21 25 on December 31, 2022, the department will assess a covered
 21 26 employer a premium rate of four=tenths of one percent of an
 21 27 employee's weekly wages, subject to a maximum limit of wages
 21 28 subject to the assessment, as determined by the director based
 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the
 22 34 family leave and medical leave insurance program for a
 22 35 minimum initial participation period of three years. Any
 23  1 subsequent period of participation must be for a minimum of
 23  2 one year. A self=employed person must pay the employee and
 23  3 employer's portion of the premium assessed by the director. A
 23  4 self=employed person who elects to participate in the program
 23  5 is eligible for family leave and medical leave benefits
 23  6 after working a minimum of 1,250 hours in the consecutive
 23  7 12=month period immediately following the self=employed
 23  8 person's election to participate in the program. The
 23  9 self=employed person may withdraw from the program by providing
 23 10 written notice to the director. The director may cancel the
 23 11 self=employed person's elective coverage for failure to submit
 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or
 23 32 childbirth. The bill requires family leave or medical leave
 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to

 23 12 the required premiums.
 23 13    An eligible employee who takes family leave or medical leave
 23 14 is entitled to restoration of employment equal to but not
 23 15 greater than that as provided by the federal Family Medical
 23 16 Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as amended. The bill provides that
 23 17 if required under FMLA, an employer must maintain any existing
 23 18 health benefits for the duration of an employee's leave. If
 23 19 the employer and employee normally share the cost of such, the
 23 20 employee remains responsible for paying the employee's share
 23 21 of the costs.
 23 22    A covered employer must submit reports as required by the
 23 23 director and maintain employment records for each employee
 23 24 from which the director may obtain information related to an
 23 25 employee's family leave or medical leave. Such records shall
 23 26 be maintained for 10 years from the date on which an employee
 23 27 first takes a family leave or medical leave and shall be open
 23 28 for inspection by the director.
 23 29    The bill provides that family leave or medical leave shall
 23 30 be in addition to leave required under state or federal law
 23 31 for sickness or temporary disability due to pregnancy or

 23 33 taken under this program to be taken concurrently with leave
 23 34 taken under FMLA.  A covered employer may allow an employee to
 23 35 choose to use either accrued sick or vacation benefits or claim
 24  1 family leave and medical leave benefits under this bill. An
 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
 24  6 any state or federally protected category.
 24  7    The bill requires the director to administer the family

 24 11    The bill provides that a family leave and medical leave
 24 12 insurance account shall be created in the custody of the
 24 13 treasurer of state. The director shall deposit all premiums
 24 14 collected from employers into such account. The account shall
 24 15 only be used for purposes of the family leave and medical leave
 24 16 insurance program as authorized by the director.
 24 17    The director shall adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A
 24 18 as necessary to implement and administer the provisions of the
 24 19 bill. The director may take any action under the director's
 24 20 authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 24 21    Code section 84A.1(1) is amended to require the department
 24 22 of workforce development to administer the laws relating to the

 24 24    The director is required to analyze the funding of the
 24 25 family leave and medical leave insurance program and the
 24 26 benefits payable from the program's account. The director
 24 27 shall determine if the  premium rates and the benefit levels
 24 28 are appropriate to fully fund and maintain the solvency of the
 24 29 family leave and medical leave insurance program. The director
 24 30 shall submit the director's findings to the general assembly

 21 29 on the maximum wages subject to taxation for social security.
 21 30 One=third of the premium is to be used to fund family leave
 21 31 insurance benefits and two=thirds of the premium is to be
 21 32 used to fund medical leave benefits. The covered employer
 21 33 may deduct the full amount of the family leave premium from
 21 34 an employee's wage. A covered employer may deduct up to 45
 21 35 percent of the medical leave premium and 45 percent of the
 22  1 family leave premium from an employee's wage. The employer
 22  2 must pay the remaining 55 percent of both the medical leave and
 22  3 family leave premiums. An employer may elect to pay all or any
 22  4 portion of an employee's share of premiums for family leave or
 22  5 medical leave benefits or both. Beginning January 1, 2023, the
 22  6 premium rate shall be calculated by the director based on the
 22  7 family leave and medical leave insurance account balance ratio
 22  8 as of September 30 of the previous calendar year. The premium
 22  9 rate is adjusted based on the balance ratio as detailed in the
 22 10 bill. If the balance ratio falls below five hundredths of one
 22 11 percent the bill requires the director to assess a solvency
 22 12 surcharge that is added to the total premium rate assessed to a
 22 13 covered employer. The minimum solvency surcharge is one=tenth
 22 14 of one percent and the maximum solvency surcharge is six=tenths
 22 15 of one percent.
 22 16    On September 30 of each year, the bill requires the
 22 17 department to average the number of employees reported by an
 22 18 employer over the last four completed calendar quarters to
 22 19 determine if an employer is a covered employer for the next
 22 20 calendar year.
 22 21    The bill requires a covered employer to collect all assessed
 22 22 premiums and surcharges from the employer's employees through
 22 23 payroll deduction and to remit all premiums to the department
 22 24 as required by the director.
 22 25    An employer may apply for, and the director must grant, a
 22 26 waiver of premiums for an employee who is located physically
 22 27 outside of the state and not expected to work in the state for
 22 28 1,250 or more hours in any consecutive 12=month period. If
 22 29 the employee subsequently works 1,250 or more hours within
 22 30 the state, the employer and employee are responsible for all
 22 31 premiums that should have been collected for such 12=month
 22 32 period.
 22 33    Self=employed persons may elect to participate in the

 24  2 employee is prohibited from receiving family leave or medical
 24  3 leave benefits at the same time the employee is receiving state
 24  4 or federal unemployment, workers' compensation, or disability
 24  5 benefits. The bill prohibits discrimination on the basis of
