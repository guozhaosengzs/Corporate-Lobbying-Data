Under
current

is
defined
to
mean
the
procedure
established
by
the
division
7


of
criminal
investigation,
department
of
public

genetic
identity.
9


The
bill
also
defines
“combined
DNA
index
system”
to
mean
a
10


national,
searchable
DNA
database
created
and
maintained
by
the
11


federal
bureau
of

where
DNA
profiles
are
stored
12


and
searched
at
a
local,
state,
or
national
level.
13


The
bill
defines
“keyboard
search”
to
mean
a
search
under
14


which
information
obtained
from
a
DNA
sample
is
compared
with
15


information
in
the
combined
DNA
index
system
without
resulting
16


in
the
information
obtained
from
the
DNA
sample
being
included
17


in
the
combined
DNA
index
system.
18


The
bill
provides
that
a
defendant
who
has
been
convicted
19


of
a
felony
or
an
aggravated
misdemeanor
may
make
a
motion
for
20


an
order
to
require
that
DNA
analysis
be
performed
on
evidence
21


collected
in
the
case
for
which
the
defendant
stands
convicted.
22


Current
law
requires
such
a
defendant
to
have
not
previously
23


submitted
a
DNA
sample
for
DNA
profiling
prior
to
the
filing
24


of
such
a
motion.
25


The
bill
requires
the
defendant’s
motion
for
an
order
to
26


require
DNA
analysis
be
performed
on
evidence
collected
in
the
27


case
to
include
a
statement
detailing
why
the
DNA
evidence
28


would
have
changed
the
outcome
of
the
trial
or
invalidated
a
29


guilty
plea
if
the
requested
DNA
testing
had
been
conducted
30


prior
to
the
conviction.
Current
law
requires
such
motion
to
31


state
why
the
DNA
evidence
would

the
DNA
profiling
results

either
DNA
testing

DNA
testing
has
been
15


previously
performed
