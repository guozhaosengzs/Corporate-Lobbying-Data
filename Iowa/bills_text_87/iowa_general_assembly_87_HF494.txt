  4 23                           EXPLANATION
  4 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 26    This bill relates to financial crime enforcement by
  4 27 assessing a drug paraphernalia surcharge and creating a money
  4 28 transfer service fee and related fund and income tax credit.
  4 29    DRUG PARAPHERNALIA SURCHARGE.  The bill provides that the
  4 30 clerk of the district court shall assess a drug paraphernalia
  4 31 surcharge of five dollars if an adjudication of guilt or
  4 32 a deferred judgment has been entered for possessing drug
  4 33 paraphernalia in violation of Code section 124.414 or a similar
  4 34 city or county ordinance.  The bill specifies that the clerk of
  4 35 the district court shall remit all moneys collected from the
  5  1 assessment of the surcharge to the state court administrator
  5  2 for deposit in the financial crime and wire transmitter fund
  5  3 established by the bill.
  5  4    MONEY TRANSFER SERVICE FEE AND RELATED FUND AND TAX CREDIT.
  5  5 The bill requires a licensee under Code chapter 533C, the
  5  6 uniform money services Act, to collect from customers a money
  5  7 transfer service fee equal to 1 percent of the amount of each
  5  8 money transfer service transaction. The bill defines "money
  5  9 transfer service" as the transmission of money by any means
  5 10 including transmission within this country or to or from
  5 11 locations abroad by payment instrument, wire, facsimile, or
  5 12 electronic transfer, courier, or otherwise.
  5 13    The bill requires such licensees to pay such fees over to the
  5 14 department of revenue. The bill requires the department, in
  5 15 consultation with the superintendent of banking, to administer
  5 16 and enforce the money transfer service fee as nearly as
  5 17 possible in conjunction with the administration and enforcement
  5 18 of the state sales and use tax law, except that portion of
  5 19 the law which implements the streamlined sales and use tax
  5 20 agreement.
  5 21    The bill permits the director of revenue to require
  5 22 licensees to register with the department for purposes of
  5 23 the bill. The bill permits the director to require a permit
  5 24 applicable only to the bill for any licensee not collecting
  5 25 taxes under Code chapter 423. The bill provides that all
  5 26 powers and requirements of the director to administer the state
  5 27 sales and use tax law are applicable to the administration of
  5 28 the money transfer service fee.
  5 29    Failure by a licensee to collect and remit money transfer
  5 30 service fees or to comply with any other provision of the bill
  5 31 shall subject the licensee to the enforcement provisions of
  5 32 article 7 of Code chapter 533C.  The bill requires the director
  5 33 and the department to cooperate with the superintendent in
  5 34 identifying violations of the bill and in discharging the
  5 35 superintendent's enforcement responsibilities under article 7
  6  1 of Code chapter 533C.
  6  2    Penalties provided for in article 7 of Code chapter 533C
  6  3 include suspension and revocation of a license under Code
  6  4 chapter 533C, civil penalties, and criminal penalties that

  6  8 not more than $10,000. A class "D" felony is punishable by
  6  9 confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at least

  5 20 agreement.
  5 21    The bill permits the director of revenue to require
  5 22 licensees to register with the department for purposes of

  5 28 the money transfer service fee.
  5 29    Failure by a licensee to collect and remit money transfer
  5 30 service fees or to comply with any other provision of the bill
  5 31 shall subject the licensee to the enforcement provisions of
  5 32 article 7 of Code chapter 533C.  The bill requires the director
  5 33 and the department to cooperate with the superintendent in

  6 17 collected under the bill shall be deposited in the financial
  6 18 crime and wire transmitter fund established by the bill.
  6 19    The bill requires a licensee furnishing money transfer
  6 20 services to post a notice in the form and manner prescribed
  6 21 by the superintendent that notifies customers that upon
  6 22 filing an individual income tax return with a valid taxpayer
  6 23 identification number, the customer shall be entitled to an
  6 24 individual income tax credit equal to the amount of money
  6 25 transfer service fees paid by the customer during the tax year.
  6 26    The bill also applies to authorized delegates of a licensee
  6 27 under Code chapter 533C.
  6 28    The bill provides an individual income tax credit equal to

  6 30 during the tax year. The bill provides that the credit shall
  6 31 not be allowed to an individual who does not include on the tax
  6 32 return for the taxable year the individual's valid taxpayer
  6 33 identification number and that of the individual's spouse if
  6 34 applicable. The bill provides that the credit is refundable
  6 35 and may be credited to the individual's tax liability for the

  7  4    The bill establishes a financial crime and wire transmitter
  7  5 fund in the office of the treasurer of state under the control

  7  8 federal moneys, are appropriated to the department of public
  7  9 safety for the purpose of investigating indictable criminal
  7 10 offenses committed for financial gain. Interest and earnings
  7 11 on moneys deposited in the fund shall be credited to the fund
  7 12 and moneys remaining in the fund at the end of the fiscal year
  7 13 shall not revert.
  7 14    The bill requires the department of public safety, for
  7 15 the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017, and for each fiscal
  7 16 year thereafter, to transfer from the fund to the general

  7 18 service fees collected or an amount of money equal to the money
  7 19 transfer service tax credits claimed in that fiscal year, if
  7 20 any. The bill provides that the moneys transferred to the
  7 21 general fund of the state in accordance with the bill shall not
  7 22 be considered new revenues for purposes of the state general
  7 23 fund expenditure limitation under Code section 8.54 but instead
  7 24 as replacement of a like amount included in the expenditure
  7 25 limitation for the fiscal year in which the transfer is made.
