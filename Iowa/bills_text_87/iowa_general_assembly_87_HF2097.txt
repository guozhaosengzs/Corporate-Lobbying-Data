  1 22    a.  "Compensation" means the same as defined in section
  1 23 422.35, subsection 14.
  1 24    b.  "Federal income tax year" means, with respect to an

  1 28 tax is computed.
  1 29    2.  Every insurance company or association of whatever kind
  1 30 or character that is subject to the tax on gross premiums
  1 31 imposed in this chapter and that is a publicly held corporation
  1 32 as defined in section 162(m)(2) of the federal Internal Revenue
  1 33 Code shall pay to the director of the department of revenue, or
  1 34 to a depository designated by the director, as a tax, an amount
  1 35 equal to one percent of the amount paid or accrued, as the case
  2  1 may be, during a federal income tax year as compensation of
  2  2 the chief executive officer, or the individual acting in such
  2  3 capacity.
  2  4    3.  If the taxable income of the insurance company or
  2  5 association for federal income tax purposes is derived from its
  2  6 business carried on entirely within this state, the tax in this
  2  7 section shall be imposed on the entire compensation, but if the
  2  8 business is carried on partly within and partly without the
  2  9 state, the portion of compensation reasonably attributable to
  2 10 the business within the state shall be specifically allocated
  2 11 or equitably apportioned within and without the state under

  2 13    4.  The tax imposed in this section shall be paid on or
  2 14 before the due date under the federal Internal Revenue Code
  2 15 for paying the federal income tax of the insurance company or
  2 16 association for the applicable federal income tax year that is
  2 17 the subject of the tax in this section, as provided by rules
  2 18 adopted by the commissioner.  The commissioner, in consultation
  2 19 with the director of the department of revenue, shall create
  2 20 and make available forms to be used in paying the tax imposed
  2 21 in this section.
  2 22    5.  The commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of a
  2 23 company or association that fails to pay its tax on or before
  2 24 the due date.
  2 25    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to tax years

  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to the taxation of compensation paid to
  2 31 chief executive officers of publicly traded corporations under
  2 32 the Iowa corporate income tax, franchise tax, and insurance
  2 33 premiums tax.  The bill defines "compensation" to be the total
  2 34 amount allowable as a business expense deduction under the
  2 35 Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for salary and compensation for
  3  1 personal services actually rendered, determined without regard
  3  2 to the deduction limitations in the IRC for certain excessive
  3  3 employee compensation or excess parachute payments.
  3  4    For purposes of calculating net income of a publicly held
  3  5 corporation under the Iowa corporate income tax, and under
  3  6 the franchise tax imposed on financial institutions, the bill
  3  7 disallows a deduction for amounts paid or accrued during a tax
  3  8 year as compensation of the chief executive officer, or the
  3  9 individual acting in such capacity.  The bill additionally
  3 10 requires the publicly held corporation to add to net income the
  3 11 amounts paid or accrued during the tax year as compensation of
  3 12 the chief executive officer, or the individual acting in such
  3 13 capacity.
  3 14    Insurance companies and associations doing business in
  3 15 Iowa are not subject to the Iowa corporate income tax or
  3 16 the franchise tax, but are instead generally subject to a 1
  3 17 percent gross premiums tax related to business done in Iowa
  3 18 on a calendar year basis.  The bill provides that any such
  3 19 insurance company or association subject to the Iowa insurance
  3 20 premiums tax that is a publicly held corporation shall also
  3 21 be subject to a tax equal to 1 percent of the amount paid or
  3 22 accrued during each federal income tax year as compensation of
  3 23 the chief executive officer, or the individual acting in such
  3 24 capacity.  "Federal income tax year" is defined in the bill to
  3 25 be the calendar year or fiscal year upon which an insurance
  3 26 company or association computes its federal income tax.  If
  3 27 the entire federal taxable income of the insurance company or
  3 28 association is derived in Iowa, then the tax is imposed on the
  3 29 entire amount of the compensation, but if business is conducted
  3 30 inside and outside of Iowa, only a portion of the compensation
  3 31 is taxable in Iowa pursuant to allocation and apportionment
  3 32 rules required to be adopted by the director of revenue.
  3 33    The tax is due on or before the due date under the IRC for
  3 34 paying the federal income tax of the insurance company or
  3 35 association for the applicable federal income tax year that
  4  1 is the subject of the compensation tax.  The bill allows the
  4  2 commissioner of insurance to suspend or revoke the license of
  4  3 any insurance company or association that fails to pay the
  4  4 compensation tax on or before the due date.
  4  5    The bill applies to tax years beginning on or after January
  4  6 1, 2019.

  2  8 business is carried on partly within and partly without the

  2 17 the subject of the tax in this section, as provided by rules
  2 18 adopted by the commissioner.  The commissioner, in consultation
  2 19 with the director of the department of revenue, shall create
  2 20 and make available forms to be used in paying the tax imposed
  2 21 in this section.
  2 22    5.  The commissioner may suspend or revoke the license of a
  2 23 company or association that fails to pay its tax on or before
  2 24 the due date.
  2 25    Sec. 3.  APPLICABILITY.  This Act applies to tax years
  2 26 beginning on or after January 1, 2019.
  2 27                           EXPLANATION
  2 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 30    This bill relates to the taxation of compensation paid to
  2 31 chief executive officers of publicly traded corporations under
  2 32 the Iowa corporate income tax, franchise tax, and insurance
  2 33 premiums tax.  The bill defines "compensation" to be the total

  2 35 Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for salary and compensation for
  3  1 personal services actually rendered, determined without regard
  3  2 to the deduction limitations in the IRC for certain excessive
  3  3 employee compensation or excess parachute payments.
  3  4    For purposes of calculating net income of a publicly held
  3  5 corporation under the Iowa corporate income tax, and under
  3  6 the franchise tax imposed on financial institutions, the bill
  3  7 disallows a deduction for amounts paid or accrued during a tax
  3  8 year as compensation of the chief executive officer, or the
  3  9 individual acting in such capacity.  The bill additionally
  3 10 requires the publicly held corporation to add to net income the
  3 11 amounts paid or accrued during the tax year as compensation of
  3 12 the chief executive officer, or the individual acting in such
  3 13 capacity.
  3 14    Insurance companies and associations doing business in
  3 15 Iowa are not subject to the Iowa corporate income tax or
  3 16 the franchise tax, but are instead generally subject to a 1
  3 17 percent gross premiums tax related to business done in Iowa
  3 18 on a calendar year basis.  The bill provides that any such
  3 19 insurance company or association subject to the Iowa insurance
  3 20 premiums tax that is a publicly held corporation shall also
  3 21 be subject to a tax equal to 1 percent of the amount paid or
  3 22 accrued during each federal income tax year as compensation of
  3 23 the chief executive officer, or the individual acting in such
  3 24 capacity.  "Federal income tax year" is defined in the bill to

  2 33 premiums tax.  The bill defines "compensation" to be the total
  2 34 amount allowable as a business expense deduction under the
  2 35 Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for salary and compensation for
  3  1 personal services actually rendered, determined without regard
  3  2 to the deduction limitations in the IRC for certain excessive
  3  3 employee compensation or excess parachute payments.
  3  4    For purposes of calculating net income of a publicly held
  3  5 corporation under the Iowa corporate income tax, and under
  3  6 the franchise tax imposed on financial institutions, the bill
  3  7 disallows a deduction for amounts paid or accrued during a tax
  3  8 year as compensation of the chief executive officer, or the
  3  9 individual acting in such capacity.  The bill additionally
  3 10 requires the publicly held corporation to add to net income the
  3 11 amounts paid or accrued during the tax year as compensation of
  3 12 the chief executive officer, or the individual acting in such
  3 13 capacity.
  3 14    Insurance companies and associations doing business in
  3 15 Iowa are not subject to the Iowa corporate income tax or
  3 16 the franchise tax, but are instead generally subject to a 1
  3 17 percent gross premiums tax related to business done in Iowa
  3 18 on a calendar year basis.  The bill provides that any such
  3 19 insurance company or association subject to the Iowa insurance
  3 20 premiums tax that is a publicly held corporation shall also
  3 21 be subject to a tax equal to 1 percent of the amount paid or
  3 22 accrued during each federal income tax year as compensation of
  3 23 the chief executive officer, or the individual acting in such
  3 24 capacity.  "Federal income tax year" is defined in the bill to
  3 25 be the calendar year or fiscal year upon which an insurance
  3 26 company or association computes its federal income tax.  If
  3 27 the entire federal taxable income of the insurance company or
  3 28 association is derived in Iowa, then the tax is imposed on the
  3 29 entire amount of the compensation, but if business is conducted
  3 30 inside and outside of Iowa, only a portion of the compensation
  3 31 is taxable in Iowa pursuant to allocation and apportionment
  3 32 rules required to be adopted by the director of revenue.
  3 33    The tax is due on or before the due date under the IRC for
  3 34 paying the federal income tax of the insurance company or
  3 35 association for the applicable federal income tax year that
  4  1 is the subject of the compensation tax.  The bill allows the
  4  2 commissioner of insurance to suspend or revoke the license of
  4  3 any insurance company or association that fails to pay the
  4  4 compensation tax on or before the due date.

  2 32 the Iowa corporate income tax, franchise tax, and insurance
  2 33 premiums tax.  The bill defines "compensation" to be the total
  2 34 amount allowable as a business expense deduction under the
  2 35 Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for salary and compensation for
  3  1 personal services actually rendered, determined without regard
  3  2 to the deduction limitations in the IRC for certain excessive
  3  3 employee compensation or excess parachute payments.
  3  4    For purposes of calculating net income of a publicly held
  3  5 corporation under the Iowa corporate income tax, and under
  3  6 the franchise tax imposed on financial institutions, the bill
  3  7 disallows a deduction for amounts paid or accrued during a tax
  3  8 year as compensation of the chief executive officer, or the
  3  9 individual acting in such capacity.  The bill additionally
  3 10 requires the publicly held corporation to add to net income the
  3 11 amounts paid or accrued during the tax year as compensation of
  3 12 the chief executive officer, or the individual acting in such
  3 13 capacity.
  3 14    Insurance companies and associations doing business in
  3 15 Iowa are not subject to the Iowa corporate income tax or
  3 16 the franchise tax, but are instead generally subject to a 1
  3 17 percent gross premiums tax related to business done in Iowa
  3 18 on a calendar year basis.  The bill provides that any such
  3 19 insurance company or association subject to the Iowa insurance
  3 20 premiums tax that is a publicly held corporation shall also
  3 21 be subject to a tax equal to 1 percent of the amount paid or
  3 22 accrued during each federal income tax year as compensation of
  3 23 the chief executive officer, or the individual acting in such
  3 24 capacity.  "Federal income tax year" is defined in the bill to
  3 25 be the calendar year or fiscal year upon which an insurance
  3 26 company or association computes its federal income tax.  If
  3 27 the entire federal taxable income of the insurance company or
  3 28 association is derived in Iowa, then the tax is imposed on the
  3 29 entire amount of the compensation, but if business is conducted
  3 30 inside and outside of Iowa, only a portion of the compensation
  3 31 is taxable in Iowa pursuant to allocation and apportionment
  3 32 rules required to be adopted by the director of revenue.
  3 33    The tax is due on or before the due date under the IRC for
  3 34 paying the federal income tax of the insurance company or
  3 35 association for the applicable federal income tax year that
  4  1 is the subject of the compensation tax.  The bill allows the
  4  2 commissioner of insurance to suspend or revoke the license of
  4  3 any insurance company or association that fails to pay the
  4  4 compensation tax on or before the due date.
  4  5    The bill applies to tax years beginning on or after January
  4  6 1, 2019.

  3  4    For purposes of calculating net income of a publicly held
  3  5 corporation under the Iowa corporate income tax, and under
  3  6 the franchise tax imposed on financial institutions, the bill
  3  7 disallows a deduction for amounts paid or accrued during a tax
  3  8 year as compensation of the chief executive officer, or the
  3  9 individual acting in such capacity.  The bill additionally
  3 10 requires the publicly held corporation to add to net income the
  3 11 amounts paid or accrued during the tax year as compensation of
  3 12 the chief executive officer, or the individual acting in such
  3 13 capacity.
  3 14    Insurance companies and associations doing business in
  3 15 Iowa are not subject to the Iowa corporate income tax or
  3 16 the franchise tax, but are instead generally subject to a 1
  3 17 percent gross premiums tax related to business done in Iowa
  3 18 on a calendar year basis.  The bill provides that any such
  3 19 insurance company or association subject to the Iowa insurance
  3 20 premiums tax that is a publicly held corporation shall also
  3 21 be subject to a tax equal to 1 percent of the amount paid or
  3 22 accrued during each federal income tax year as compensation of
  3 23 the chief executive officer, or the individual acting in such
  3 24 capacity.  "Federal income tax year" is defined in the bill to
  3 25 be the calendar year or fiscal year upon which an insurance
  3 26 company or association computes its federal income tax.  If
  3 27 the entire federal taxable income of the insurance company or
  3 28 association is derived in Iowa, then the tax is imposed on the
  3 29 entire amount of the compensation, but if business is conducted
  3 30 inside and outside of Iowa, only a portion of the compensation
  3 31 is taxable in Iowa pursuant to allocation and apportionment
  3 32 rules required to be adopted by the director of revenue.
  3 33    The tax is due on or before the due date under the IRC for
  3 34 paying the federal income tax of the insurance company or
  3 35 association for the applicable federal income tax year that
  4  1 is the subject of the compensation tax.  The bill allows the

  3  7 disallows a deduction for amounts paid or accrued during a tax

  2 32 the Iowa corporate income tax, franchise tax, and insurance
  2 33 premiums tax.  The bill defines "compensation" to be the total
  2 34 amount allowable as a business expense deduction under the
  2 35 Internal Revenue Code (IRC) for salary and compensation for
  3  1 personal services actually rendered, determined without regard
  3  2 to the deduction limitations in the IRC for certain excessive
  3  3 employee compensation or excess parachute payments.
  3  4    For purposes of calculating net income of a publicly held
  3  5 corporation under the Iowa corporate income tax, and under
  3  6 the franchise tax imposed on financial institutions, the bill
  3  7 disallows a deduction for amounts paid or accrued during a tax
  3  8 year as compensation of the chief executive officer, or the
  3  9 individual acting in such capacity.  The bill additionally
  3 10 requires the publicly held corporation to add to net income the
  3 11 amounts paid or accrued during the tax year as compensation of
  3 12 the chief executive officer, or the individual acting in such
  3 13 capacity.
  3 14    Insurance companies and associations doing business in
  3 15 Iowa are not subject to the Iowa corporate income tax or
  3 16 the franchise tax, but are instead generally subject to a 1
  3 17 percent gross premiums tax related to business done in Iowa
  3 18 on a calendar year basis.  The bill provides that any such
  3 19 insurance company or association subject to the Iowa insurance
  3 20 premiums tax that is a publicly held corporation shall also
  3 21 be subject to a tax equal to 1 percent of the amount paid or
  3 22 accrued during each federal income tax year as compensation of
  3 23 the chief executive officer, or the individual acting in such
  3 24 capacity.  "Federal income tax year" is defined in the bill to
  3 25 be the calendar year or fiscal year upon which an insurance
  3 26 company or association computes its federal income tax.  If
  3 27 the entire federal taxable income of the insurance company or
  3 28 association is derived in Iowa, then the tax is imposed on the
  3 29 entire amount of the compensation, but if business is conducted
  3 30 inside and outside of Iowa, only a portion of the compensation
  3 31 is taxable in Iowa pursuant to allocation and apportionment
  3 32 rules required to be adopted by the director of revenue.
  3 33    The tax is due on or before the due date under the IRC for
  3 34 paying the federal income tax of the insurance company or
  3 35 association for the applicable federal income tax year that
  4  1 is the subject of the compensation tax.  The bill allows the
  4  2 commissioner of insurance to suspend or revoke the license of
  4  3 any insurance company or association that fails to pay the
  4  4 compensation tax on or before the due date.
  4  5    The bill applies to tax years beginning on or after January
  4  6 1, 2019.
