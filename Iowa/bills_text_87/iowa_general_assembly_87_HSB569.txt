21


proceeding.

case

and
a
notice
of
3

penalty
has
been
filed,
in

to
4


any

defenses
which

the
5


defendant
may
raise
the
issue
of
intellectual

or
6


mental
illness
during
the
time
of
filing
pretrial
motions.
7


Once
the
evidence
is
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
court
8


will
instruct
the
jury,
at
the
defendant’s
request,
that
in
9


considering
whether
a
sentence
of
death
is
justified,
the

race,

origin,

or
12


of
any
victim
is
not
to
be
considered.
The
supreme
court
13


shall
collect
evidence
relating
to
whether
the
death
sentences
14


imposed
are
excessive,
disproportionate,
or
imposed
under
the
15


influence
of
prejudice
at
trial
which
will
be
available
to
16


litigants.
17


The
sentence
of
death
is
imposed
only
when
the
trier
of
fact
18


(the
jury
or
the
court
if
the
defendant
has
waived
the
right
to
19


a
jury
trial)
unanimously
answers
two
questions
affirmatively:
20


(1)
whether
aggravating
circumstances
established
beyond
21


a
reasonable
doubt
outweigh
any
mitigating
circumstances
22


that
may
exist;
and
(2)
whether
the
defendant
should
be
23


sentenced
to
death.
Mitigating
factors
the
trier
of
fact
may
24


consider
include
the
following:
the
defendant
was
under
the
25


influence
of
an
extreme
mental
or
emotional
disturbance;
the
26


age
of
the
defendant;
the
defendant’s
ability
to
appreciate
27


the
wrongfulness
of
the
conduct
due
to
mental
disease
but
28


not
to
a
degree
to
constitute
a
defense;
the
defendant
has
29


no
significant
prior
criminal
history;
the
defendant
was
30


under
extreme
duress;
the
defendant
did
not
directly
commit
31


the
murder;
and
the
defendant’s
character
or
record
or
the
32


circumstances
of
the
offense.
The
sentencing
proceeding
is
33


conducted
separately
from
the
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence
by
34


the
same
trier
of
fact.

For
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
trier
of
fact
(the
jury
1


or
the
court
if
the
defendant
has
waived
the
right
to
have
2


the
jury
hear
the
proceedings)
is
to
weigh
any
aggravating
3


circumstances
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by
the
4


state
against
any
of
the
enumerated
mitigating
circumstances
5


which
may
be
presented
by
the
defendant.
Evidence
of
certain
6


juvenile
delinquency
adjudications
is
not
admissible
in
any
7


proceeding
to
determine
the
sentence.
If
the
jury
fails
to
8


agree
unanimously
on
the
required
affirmative
findings,
the
9


penalty
imposed
would
be
life
imprisonment.
10


The
death
penalty
sentence
would
be
reviewed
automatically
11


by
the
supreme
court.
The
supreme
court
shall
review
the
trial
12


and
judgment
separately
from
the
sentencing
proceeding.
If
the
13


supreme
court
finds
error
in
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
14


supreme
court
may
remand
the
case
back
to
district
court
for
a
15


new
sentencing
hearing.
The
bill
requires
the
supreme
court
to
16


examine
whether
the
sentence
is
excessive
or
disproportionate
17


to
penalties
in
similar
cases.
If
affirmed
by
the
supreme
18


court,
the
penalty
would
be
accomplished
by
lethal
injection.
19


The
bill
requires
the
board
of
corrections
to
adopt
rules
20


pertaining
to
executions,
including
rules
pertaining
to
the
21


witnessing
of
executions.
22


A
person
who
is
sentenced
to
death,
but
who
is
pregnant
when
23


the
warrant
of
execution
is
issued,
is
not
to
be
executed
until
24


the
person
is
no
longer
pregnant.
A
procedure
is
also
provided
25


to
stay
execution
of
a
condemned
inmate
who
becomes
insane
26


after
conviction
but
before
execution.


27


An
employee
of
the
state
shall
not
be
required
to
perform
or
28


assist
in
any
execution
and
shall
not
be
discriminated
against
29


for
refusing
to
participate.
30


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
31


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
32


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
33


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
34


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
