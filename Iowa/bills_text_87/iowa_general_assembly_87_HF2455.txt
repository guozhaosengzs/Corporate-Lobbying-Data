 14 19                           EXPLANATION
 14 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 22    This bill relates to the division of a domestic stock insurer
 14 23 into two or more domestic stock insurers.
 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 14 10    A dividing insurer and the dividing insurer's officers,

 14 12 and execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 14 13 resulting insurer, to execute and deliver documents, plans,
 14 14 certificates, and resolutions, and to make any filings on
 14 15 behalf of such resulting insurer. If provided in a plan of
 14 16 merger or consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be
 14 17 effective simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division
 14 18 pursuant to 521I.10.
 14 19                           EXPLANATION
 14 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 22    This bill relates to the division of a domestic stock insurer
 14 23 into two or more domestic stock insurers.
 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to

 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights

 14 19                           EXPLANATION
 14 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 22    This bill relates to the division of a domestic stock insurer
 14 23 into two or more domestic stock insurers.
 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 14 19                           EXPLANATION
 14 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 22    This bill relates to the division of a domestic stock insurer
 14 23 into two or more domestic stock insurers.
 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 14 19                           EXPLANATION
 14 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 22    This bill relates to the division of a domestic stock insurer
 14 23 into two or more domestic stock insurers.
 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 14 19                           EXPLANATION
 14 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 22    This bill relates to the division of a domestic stock insurer
 14 23 into two or more domestic stock insurers.
 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 14 19                           EXPLANATION
 14 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 22    This bill relates to the division of a domestic stock insurer
 14 23 into two or more domestic stock insurers.
 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 14 19                           EXPLANATION
 14 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 22    This bill relates to the division of a domestic stock insurer
 14 23 into two or more domestic stock insurers.
 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant

 14 19                           EXPLANATION
 14 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 22    This bill relates to the division of a domestic stock insurer
 14 23 into two or more domestic stock insurers.
 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be

 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 14 19                           EXPLANATION
 14 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 22    This bill relates to the division of a domestic stock insurer
 14 23 into two or more domestic stock insurers.
 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 14 19                           EXPLANATION
 14 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 22    This bill relates to the division of a domestic stock insurer
 14 23 into two or more domestic stock insurers.
 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 14 20 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 14 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 22    This bill relates to the division of a domestic stock insurer
 14 23 into two or more domestic stock insurers.
 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 14 21 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 14 22    This bill relates to the division of a domestic stock insurer
 14 23 into two or more domestic stock insurers.
 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is

 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign

 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the

 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the

 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the

 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 14 22    This bill relates to the division of a domestic stock insurer
 14 23 into two or more domestic stock insurers.
 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 14 23 into two or more domestic stock insurers.
 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing

 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business

 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting

 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.

 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 14 24    The bill defines a dividing insurer as a domestic stock
 14 25 insurer that approves a plan of division. A resulting insurer
 14 26 is defined as a dividing insurer that survives a division, or a
 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 14 27 new domestic stock insurer that is created by a division.
 14 28    The bill requires a dividing insurer to develop a plan
 14 29 of division that identifies the dividing insurer's name, the
 14 30 proposed resulting insurers and their articles of incorporation
 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and

 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not

 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to

 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;

 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the

 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the

 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided

 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's

 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come

 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the

 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the

 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,

 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of

 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes

 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill

 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly

 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the

 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an

 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends

 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 14 31 and bylaws, the allocation of the dividing insurer's assets,
 14 32 liabilities, and reinsurance contracts to the resulting
 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the

 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of

 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,

 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the

 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided

 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the

 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan

 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the

 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 14 33 insurers, and the manner in which the shares in the resulting
 14 34 insurers will be distributed to the dividing insurer or its
 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is

 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided

 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the

 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated

 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the

 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,

 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes

 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or

 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill

 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 14 35 shareholders. The plan of division must also comply with all
 15  1 terms of the dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and
 15  2 bylaws.
 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan

 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to

 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of

 15 22 of a merger.

 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to

 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the

 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by

 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan

 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come

 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated

 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes

 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the

 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,

 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of

 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If

 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill

 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.

 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a

 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 15  3    If the dividing insurer will survive the division, the plan
 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 15  4 of division must also include any proposed amendments to the
 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 15  5 dividing insurer's articles of incorporation and bylaws and
 15  6 the manner in which the dividing insurer proposes to cancel or
 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of

 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to

 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 15  7 convert some of its shares. If the dividing insurer will not
 15  8 survive the division, the plan of division must include details
 15  9 on how the dividing insurer will cancel or convert its shares
 15 10 into securities, obligations, other property, or rights to
 15 11 acquire shares or securities.
 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.

 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.

 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing

 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does

 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a

 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 15 12    The bill allows a dividing insurer to amend or cancel a plan
 15 13 of division, and allows a shareholder to vote or consent to an
 15 14 amendment, under certain conditions as detailed in the bill.
 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to

 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,

 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.

 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.

 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an

 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of

 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 15 15    The bill requires that prior to filing a plan of division
 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.

 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 15 16 with the commissioner, a dividing insurer must obtain approval
 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing

 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 15 17 in accordance with all provisions of the dividing insurer's
 15 18 articles of incorporation and bylaws. If the articles of
 15 19 incorporation and bylaws do not provide for approval of a plan
 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of

 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing

 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers

 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,

 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.

 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 15 20 of division, the dividing insurer must obtain approval in
 15 21 accordance with all provisions of such that apply to approval
 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of

 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights

 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 15 22 of a merger.
 15 23    The bill provides that a division shall not become effective
 15 24 until approved by the commissioner after reasonable notice
 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.

 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing

 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to

 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division

 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come

 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing

 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the

 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes

 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the

 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 15 25 and a public hearing. The commissioner may approve a plan of
 15 26 division if the commissioner determines that the interests of
 15 27 the policyholders, creditors, or shareholders of the dividing
 15 28 insurer are adequately protected and the proposed division is
 15 29 not unfair or unreasonable to the policyholders of the dividing
 15 30 insurer; that the division is not contrary to public policy;
 15 31 that the financial condition of the resulting insurers will
 15 32 not jeopardize the financial stability of a dividing insurer
 15 33 or the resulting insurers or prejudice the interests of the
 15 34 policyholders of such insurers; that all resulting insurers
 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come

 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation

 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,

 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with

 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the

 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the

 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided

 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the

 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.

 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.

 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a

 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes

 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,

 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an

 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be

 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come

 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.

 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the

 15 35 created by the proposed division are qualified and eligible to
 16  1 receive a certificate of authority to transact the business
 16  2 of insurance in this state; that the proposed division does
 16  3 not violate the state's voidable transactions statute; that
 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which

 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 16  4 the proposed division is not for the purpose of hindering,
 16  5 delaying, or defrauding any policyholders or other creditors
 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.

 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 16  6 of the dividing insurer; that all resulting insurers will be
 16  7 solvent; and that the remaining assets of a resulting insurer
 16  8 will not be unreasonably small in relation to the business and
 16  9 transactions in which such resulting insurer has been engaged
 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.

 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of

 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 16 10 in or will engage in after completion of the division.
 16 11    The bill requires the commissioner to issue an order,
 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.

 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or

 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided

 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires

 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.

 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the

 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a

 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes

 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 16 12 including findings of fact and conclusions of law, to approve
 16 13 a plan of division. The commissioner is required to issue a
 16 14 certificate of authority to the resulting insurers. If the
 16 15 plan of division has been approved by the commissioner in a
 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the

 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or

 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer

 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come

 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes

 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the

 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 16 16 final order, any conditions required to remove liabilities of
 16 17 the dividing insurer from the resulting insurer, or to allocate
 16 18 some or all of the liabilities of the dividing insurer to the
 16 19 resulting insurers, are deemed satisfied.
 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.

 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.

 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights

 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 16 20    All information and documents submitted to, obtained by, or
 16 21 disclosed to the commissioner in connection with a dividing
 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.

 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be

 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.

 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights

 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a

 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the

 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the

 16 22 insurer's plan of division are confidential and not available
 16 23 for public inspection until the commissioner has provided
 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come

 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other

 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the

 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have

 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or

 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not

 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,

 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes

 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the

 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly

 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan

 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other

 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the

 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the

 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or

 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of

 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes

 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,

 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the

 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to

 16 24 notice of a public hearing. After issuance of such notice,
 16 25 the dividing insurer may submit a written request to the
 16 26 commissioner to continue treating all business, financial,
 16 27 and actuarial information as confidential. The bill requires
 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan

 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's

 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other

 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the

 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the

 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the

 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes

 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision

 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated

 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes

 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the

 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 16 28 that the plan of division and any materials incorporated by
 16 29 reference into or otherwise made a part of such plan shall not
 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 16 30 be confidential and shall be available for public inspection.
 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,

 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 16 31    If the commissioner approves a dividing insurer's plan
 16 32 of division, an officer of the dividing insurer shall sign
 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the

 16 33 a certificate of division that sets forth information, as
 16 34 detailed in the bill, related to the dividing insurer's
 16 35 post=division status and any resulting insurer's post=division
 17  1 status. A dividing insurer's certificate of division
 17  2 is effective on the date the dividing insurer files the
 17  3 certificate with the secretary of state or on another date
 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.

 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective
 20 13 simultaneously with the effectiveness of a division under the
 20 14 bill.

 17  4 as specified in the plan of division, whichever is later.
 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant

 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of

 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 17  5 However, the certificate of division shall become effective
 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.

 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation

 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the

 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the

 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be

 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as

 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations

 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.
 20  4    The bill amends Code section 490.120 to add a plan of
 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 17  6 not later than 90 days after it is filed with the secretary of
 17  7 state.
 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.

 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a
 20 11 resulting insurer and if provided for in the plan of merger or
 20 12 consolidation, the merger or consolidation shall be effective

 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come

 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.

 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the

 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,

 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant

 17  8    When a division becomes effective and the dividing insurer
 17  9 survives, the bill provides that the dividing insurer continues
 17 10 to exist and that the articles of incorporation and the bylaws
 17 11 of the dividing insurer must be amended as provided in the
 17 12 plan of division. If the dividing insurer does not survive,
 17 13 the dividing insurer's separate existence ceases to exist and
 17 14 any resulting insurers created by the plan of division come
 17 15 into existence. The bill provides that all resulting insurers
 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated
 17 17 to each as a successor to the dividing insurer by operation
 17 18 of law, and not by transfer. All capital, surplus, and other
 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If

 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or

 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly

 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing

 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the

 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.

 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights
 20  7 for a division to which a corporation is a party, if the
 20  8 corporation does not survive such division. The bill amends
 20  9 Code chapter 521 to allow a dividing insurer to adopt and
 20 10 execute a plan of merger or consolidation on behalf of a

 17 16 shall hold any capital, surplus, and other assets allocated

 17 19 assets of the dividing insurer that are allocated by the plan
 17 20 of division either vest in the applicable resulting insurer
 17 21 or remain vested in the dividing insurer as provided in the
 17 22 plan of division. All capital, surplus, and other assets that
 17 23 are not allocated by the plan of division remain vested in the
 17 24 dividing insurer if the dividing insurer survives the division,
 17 25 are allocated to the resulting insurers individually if the
 17 26 dividing insurer does not survive the division, or vest as
 17 27 otherwise provided in the bill.
 17 28    A resulting insurer to which a cause of action is allocated
 17 29 may be substituted or added in any pending action to which
 17 30 the dividing insurer is a party when the division becomes
 17 31 effective. All liabilities of a dividing insurer are allocated
 17 32 between or among any resulting insurers and each resulting
 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.

 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,

 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes

 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill

 17 33 insurer to which liabilities are allocated is liable only for
 17 34 those liabilities, including policy liabilities, allocated as a
 17 35 successor to the dividing insurer.
 18  1 The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.

 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.

 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.

 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.

 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the

 18  2 effective any shares in the dividing insurer that are to
 18  3 be converted or canceled in the division are converted or
 18  4 canceled, and the shareholders of those shares are entitled
 18  5 only to the rights provided to such shareholders under the
 18  6 plan of division and per any appraisal rights they may have
 18  7 as detailed in the bill. Except as provided in the dividing
 18  8 insurer's articles of incorporation or bylaws, the division
 18  9 does not give any rights to a shareholder, director, or third
 18 10 party that such would have upon a dissolution, liquidation, or
 18 11 winding up of the domestic stock insurer.
 18 12    Unless otherwise provided in the plan of division, the
 18 13 shares and securities of each resulting insurer are distributed
 18 14 to the dividing insurer if it survives the division, or pro
 18 15 rata to any shareholders of the dividing insurer that do not
 18 16 assert appraisal rights.
 18 17    The bill provides that when a division becomes effective,
 18 18 each resulting insurer is individually liable for all
 18 19 liabilities that such resulting insurer issues, undertakes,
 18 20 or incurs in its own name after the division; each resulting
 18 21 insurer is individually liable for the liabilities of
 18 22 the dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the
 18 23 liability of such resulting insurer as specified in the plan
 18 24 of division; and the dividing insurer remains responsible for
 18 25 all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not allocated
 18 26 by the plan of division if the dividing insurer survives
 18 27 the division. If the dividing insurer does not survive the
 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,
 19 15 surplus, assets, or liabilities, including policy liabilities,
 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with
 19 18 respect to either the dividing insurer or any of the resulting
 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are
 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the
 19 28 policy or liability. A reinsurer, surety, or guarantor of the
 19 29 policy or liability is not released from their obligations
 19 30 under the policy or other liability.
 19 31    If a dividing insurer does not survive a division, an
 19 32 objecting shareholder of the dividing insurer is entitled to
 19 33 appraisal rights and to obtain payment of the fair value of
 19 34 such shareholder's shares.
 19 35    The bill requires the commissioner to adopt rules pursuant
 20  1 to Code chapter 17A to administer the requirements of the
 20  2 bill and allows the commissioner to take any action under the
 20  3 commissioner's authority to enforce compliance with the bill.

 20  5 division to the definition of plan. The bill amends Code
 20  6 section 490.1302 to provide for shareholder appraisal rights

 18 28 division, each resulting insurer is pro rata individually
 18 29 liable for all liabilities of the dividing insurer that are not
 18 30 allocated by the plan of division.
 18 31    The bill also provides that when a division becomes
 18 32 effective, no resulting insurer is liable for any liabilities
 18 33 that another resulting insurer issues, undertakes, or incurs in
 18 34 its own name after the division, or for any liabilities of the
 18 35 dividing insurer that are allocated to or remain the liability
 19  1 of another resulting insurer per the plan of division. If
 19  2 any provision of any evidence of indebtedness or a provision
 19  3 of any contract other than an insurance policy, annuity, or
 19  4 reinsurance agreement that was issued, incurred, or executed
 19  5 by the dividing insurer before the effective date of the bill
 19  6 requires the consent of the obligee to a merger of the dividing
 19  7 insurer, or treats such a merger as a default, such provision
 19  8 applies to a division of the dividing insurer as if such
 19  9 division were a merger.
 19 10    If a division breaches a contractual obligation of the
 19 11 dividing insurer, all resulting insurers are liable, jointly
 19 12 and severally, for the breach. The validity and effectiveness
 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,

 19 21 not impaired by the division.
 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
 19 24 policy or other liability does not affect the rights that a
 19 25 policyholder or creditor has under any other law with respect
 19 26 to such policy or other liability, except that such rights are
 19 27 available only against a resulting insurer responsible for the

 19 13 of the division are not affected by the breach.
 19 14    In a division, a direct or indirect allocation of capital,

 19 16 occurs automatically by operation of law and shall not be
 19 17 treated as a distribution or transfer for any purpose with

 19 19 insurers. Liens, security interests, and other charges on the
 19 20 capital, surplus, or other assets of the dividing insurer are

 19 22    Except as provided in the plan of division and as
 19 23 specifically approved by the commissioner, an allocation of a
