  1 16 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 17 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.

  1 25 disposition of the decedent's remains or ceremonies to be held
  1 26 after the decedent's death must be carried out, to the extent
  1 27 that such directives are reasonable under the circumstances.
  1 28    Currently, Code chapter 144C provides that a person
