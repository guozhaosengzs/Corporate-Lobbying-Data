  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.
  7 13    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  4 29    Sec. 6.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act, being deemed of immediate
  4 30 importance, takes effect upon enactment.
  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.
  7 13    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.
  7 13    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.
  7 13    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.
  7 13    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a

  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day

  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior

  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the

  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under

  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.
  7 13    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day

  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior

  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the

  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy

  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to

  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day

  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and

  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring

  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the

  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in

  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at

  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term

  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter

  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated

  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts

  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the

  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy

  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under

  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from

  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that

  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term

  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and

  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring

  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at

  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.
  7 13    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day

  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one

  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology

  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in

  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at

  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at

  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.
  7 13    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.
  7 13    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.
  7 13    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the

  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a

  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract

  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at

  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition

  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under

  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter

  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and

  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to

  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to

  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and

  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.

  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and

  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to

  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under

  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.
  7 13    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.
  7 13    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  2 10 managed care organization shall reimburse the provider for

  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior

  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring

  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under

  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.
  7 13    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  2 15 the managed care organization assuming the member's coverage
  2 16 at least thirty days prior to the managed care organization
  2 17 assuming such coverage.
  2 18    c.  If a provider provides services to a member for which the
  2 19 member is eligible while awaiting any necessary authorization,
  2 20 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  2 21 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  2 22 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.

  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter

  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a

  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming

  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in

  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at

  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)

  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition

  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a

  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.

  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.

  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March

  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The

  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy

  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires

  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology

  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to

  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and

  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at

  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa

  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day

  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the

  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in

  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization

  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter

  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and

  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March

  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts

  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to

  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the

  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior

  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming

  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to

  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a

  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at

  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day

  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter

  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a

  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 31                           EXPLANATION
  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.

  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.

  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming

  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services

  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under

  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  4 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 34    This bill directs the department of human services (DHS)
  4 35 to provide written notice in accordance with the termination
  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa
  5  3 high quality health care initiative as established by the
  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term
  5  7 services and supports population to fee=for=service program
  5  8 administration.  The transition is to be based on a transition
  5  9 plan developed by the department and submitted to the council
  5 10 on human services and the medical assistance advisory council
  5 11 for review.
  5 12    The bill requires DHS to adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter
  5 13 17A and to amend existing Medicaid managed care contracts to
  5 14 carve out SPMI integrated health homes services as specified
  5 15 in the Medicaid state plan amendment, IA=16=013, from Medicaid
  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring
  6  2 shall forward the member's records to the MCO  assuming the
  6  3 member's coverage at least 30 days prior to the MCO assuming
  6  4 such coverage.   Additionally, if a provider provides services
  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.

  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
  7 10 internet site.
  7 11    The bill requires DHS to seek any Medicaid state plan or
  7 12 waiver amendments necessary to administer the bill.

  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a

  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's

  5  1 provisions of the contract, to each managed care organization
  5  2 (MCO) with whom DHS executed a contract to administer the Iowa

  5  4 department, to terminate such contracts as applicable to the
  5  5 long=term services and supports population, following a 60=day
  5  6 transition period.  DHS is directed to transfer the long=term

  5 16 managed care contracts and instead provide SPMI integrated
  5 17 health home services through the fee=for=service payment and
  5 18 delivery system.
  5 19    The bill requires DHS to use Medicaid program claims paid
  5 20 data for the period beginning April 1, 2015, and ending March
  5 21 31, 2016, as base data to develop and certify capitation
  5 22 rates for providers of home and community=based intellectual
  5 23 disability waiver services under Medicaid managed care for the
  5 24 fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 25    The bill provides for Medicaid managed care oversight.  The
  5 26 bill requires DHS to amend the Medicaid managed care contracts
  5 27 and adopt rules pursuant to Code chapter 17A to provide for a
  5 28 number of changes, beginning July 1, 2018.
  5 29    The bill requires MCOs to provide prior written notice to a
  5 30 member and to any affected provider of any change in the status
  5 31 of the member that affects such provider at least 30 days prior
  5 32 to the effective date of the change in status.  If notification
  5 33 is not received by the provider and the member continues to
  5 34 receive services from the provider, the MCO shall reimburse the
  5 35 provider for services rendered. If a member transfers from one
  6  1 MCO to another, the MCO from which the member is transferring

  6  5 to a member for which the member is eligible while the provider
  6  6 is awaiting any necessary authorization to provide the service,
  6  7 and the authorization is subsequently approved, the provider
  6  8 shall be reimbursed at the contracted rate for any services
  6  9 provided prior to receipt of the authorization.
  6 10    With regard to data, the bill requires that MCOs, in addition
  6 11 to reporting to DHS the percentage of medical and pharmacy
  6 12 clean claims paid or denied within a certain time frame, to
  6 13 also report additional data regarding claims as specified in
  6 14 the bill on a quarterly basis.
  6 15    With regard to reimbursement, the bill requires
  6 16 reimbursement beginning July 1, 2018, for Medicaid providers
  6 17 and services, to be calculated based on the methodology
  6 18 in effect on June 30, 2018, for the respective provider or
  6 19 service for fee=for=service claims and for claims subject to
  6 20 a managed care contract, reimbursement shall be based on the
  6 21 methodology established by the managed care contract. However,
  6 22 any reimbursement established under such contract shall not be
  6 23 lower than the rate floor established by DHS as a rate floor
  6 24 for the respective provider or service in effect on June 30,
  6 25 2018. Additionally, for any provider or service to which a
  6 26 reimbursement increase is applicable for the fiscal year under
  6 27 state law beginning July 1, 2018, upon the effective date of
  6 28 the reimbursement increase, DHS shall modify the rate floor in
  6 29 effect on June 30, 2018, to reflect the increase specified and
  6 30 any reimbursement established under the managed care contract
  6 31 shall not be lower than the rate floor as modified. Any
  6 32 reimbursement established between the managed care organization
  6 33 and the provider shall be in effect for at least 12 months from
  6 34 the date established, unless the reimbursement is increased.  A
  6 35 reimbursement rate negotiated and established above the rate
  7  1 floor shall not be decreased from that negotiated amount for at
  7  2 least a 12=month period.
  7  3    With regard to prior authorization, the bill requires that
  7  4 any change by an MCO in a requirement for prior authorization
  7  5 for a prescription drug or service shall be preceded by 60
  7  6 days' prior written notice published on the MCO's internet site
  7  7 and provided in writing to all affected members and providers
  7  8 before the effective date of the change. The bill requires
  7  9 an MCO to place certain prior authorization data on the MCO's
