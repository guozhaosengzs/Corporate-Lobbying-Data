H.F.
_____


the
illegal
conduct.
1


The
bill
requires
the
release
to
the
press
of
the
name
of
2


any
person
arrested
for
prostitution.
The
bill
requires
that
3


any
information
released
complies
with
the
confidentiality
4


requirements
of
Code
section
22.7(5)
and
22.7(9).
Arrest
is
5


defined
in
the
bill.
6


If
a
person
is
arrested
for
prostitution
pursuant
to
Code
7


section
725.1,
a
motor
vehicle
the
person
uses
in
any
manner
to
8


facilitate
the
illegal
conduct
shall
be
subject
to
forfeiture.
9


If
the
person
is
convicted,
the
bill
requires
the
forfeited
10


motor
vehicle
to
be
destroyed.
11


Typically,
property
with
a
value
of
$5,000
or
more
may
12


be
forfeited
even
if
the
conduct
giving
rise
to
forfeiture
13


does
not
result
in
a
conviction.
The
bill
provides
that
14


for
a
motor
vehicle
used
to
facilitate
the
public
offense
of
15


prostitution,
a
conviction
is
required
before
forfeiture
may
16


result,
regardless
of
the
value
of
the
motor
vehicle.
17


Under
current
law,
property
is
exempt
from
forfeiture
if
the
18


owner
of
the
property
was
not
involved
with
and
was
not
aware
19


of
the
conduct
giving
rise
to
forfeiture
or
if
the
property
was
20


purchased
after
the
conduct
giving
rise
to
forfeiture
in
good
21


faith
and
for
value
by
a
person
not
involved
with
the
conduct
22


giving
rise
to
forfeiture.
The
bill
provides
that
these
23


exemptions
do
not
apply
to
the
forfeiture
of
a
motor
vehicle
24


used
to
facilitate
the
public
offense
of
prostitution.
