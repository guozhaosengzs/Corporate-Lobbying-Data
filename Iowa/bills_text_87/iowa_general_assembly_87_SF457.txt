  3 14    1.  The department shall establish and implement a plan for
  3 15 achieving continuous quality improvement in the care provided
  3 16 under a statewide system for stroke response and treatment.
  3 17 In implementing the plan, the department shall do all of the
  3 18 following:
  3 19    a.  Maintain a statewide stroke database that compiles
  3 20 information and statistics on stroke care that align with
  3 21 the stroke consensus metrics developed and approved by the
  3 22 American heart association and the American stroke association.
  3 23 The department shall utilize the "get with the guidelines =
  3 24 stroke" or another nationally recognized data set platform with
  3 25 confidentiality standards no less secure than those utilized
  3 26 by the department for the statewide stroke database.  To the
  3 27 extent possible, the department shall coordinate with national
  3 28 voluntary health organizations involved in stroke quality
  3 29 improvement to avoid duplication and redundancy.
  3 30    b.  Require comprehensive stroke centers and primary
  3 31 stroke centers and encourage acute stroke=ready hospitals and
  3 32 emergency medical services providers to report data consistent
  3 33 with nationally recognized guidelines on the treatment of
  3 34 individuals with confirmed stroke within the state.
  3 35    2.  All data reported under this section shall be made
  4  1 available to the department and to any other agencies that
  4  2 have responsibility for the management and administration of
  4  3 emergency medical services throughout the state.
  4  4    3.  Beginning September 1, 2017, and by each September 1,
  4  5 thereafter, the department shall provide a summary report of
  4  6 the data collected under this section to the governor and the
  4  7 general assembly summarizing the progress made in improving
  4  8 quality of care and patient outcomes for individuals with
  4  9 stroke.  All data shall be reported in the aggregate form and
  4 10 shall be posted on the department's internet site.
  4 11                           EXPLANATION
  4 12 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4 13 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4 14    This bill relates to stroke care quality improvement.
  4 15    The bill provides for recognition by the department of
  4 16 public health of accreditation by nationally recognized
  4 17 organizations that provide accreditation, for certification of
  4 18 a hospital as a comprehensive stroke center, a primary stroke
  4 19 center, or an acute stroke=ready hospital, as applicable,
  4 20 if the hospital is in good standing with and maintains
  4 21 certification through such national organization.
  4 22    The bill provides for suspension or revocation of a
  4 23 hospital's certification as a comprehensive stroke center,
  4 24 primary stroke center, or acute stroke=ready hospital, after
  4 25 notice and hearing, if the department determines that the
  4 26 hospital is not in compliance with the requirements of the bill
  4 27 or the rules adopted under the bill.
  4 28    The bill encourages comprehensive stroke centers and primary
  4 29 stroke centers to coordinate efforts, through coordinated
  4 30 stroke care agreements, with acute stroke=ready hospitals
  4 31 throughout the state, to provide appropriate access to care
  4 32 for acute stroke patients. The coordinating stroke care
  4 33 agreement shall be in writing and shall include, at a minimum,
  4 34 transfer agreements between acute stroke=ready hospitals
  4 35 and comprehensive stroke centers or primary stroke centers
  5  1 and communication criteria and protocols with the acute
  5  2 stroke=ready hospital.
  5  3    The bill requires that by January 15, annually, DPH shall
  5  4 forward the current list of the designated comprehensive
  5  5 stroke centers, primary stroke centers, and acute stroke=ready
  5  6 hospitals, to the medical director of each licensed emergency
  5  7 medical services provider in the state, maintain a copy of the
  5  8 list, and post the list on the department's internet site.
  5  9 The department shall specify by rule a nationally recognized
  5 10 standardized sample stroke triage assessment tool, distribute
  5 11 the tool to each licensed emergency medical services provider
  5 12 and post the tool on the department's internet site.   Each
  5 13 licensed emergency medical services provider shall use the
  5 14 sample tool or, alternatively, a stroke triage assessment tool
  5 15 that is substantially similar to the sample tool as part of the
  5 16 state stroke triage process.
  5 17    The bill requires all licensed emergency medical services
  5 18 providers in the state to establish prehospital care protocols
  5 19 related to the assessment, treatment, and transport of stroke
  5 20 patients.
  5 21    All licensed emergency medical services providers are
  5 22 also required to establish, as part of current training
  5 23 requirements, protocols to assure that licensed emergency
  5 24 medical services providers and 911 dispatch personnel receive
  5 25 regular training on the assessment and treatment of stroke
  5 26 patients.
  5 27    The bill requires DPH to establish and implement a plan
  5 28 for achieving continuous quality improvement in the care
  5 29 provided under a statewide system for stroke response and
  5 30 treatment. In implementing the plan, the department shall:

  6  2 the state.
  6  3    The bill requires that beginning September 1, 2017, and
