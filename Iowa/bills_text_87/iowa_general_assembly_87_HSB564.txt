the

bill
requires
that
the

core

in

PRACTITIONER
PREPARATION

——
STATE
BOARD
RULES.
The

a

prescribe
10


standards

procedures
for
the
approval
of
practitioner

programs

offered
in

(department

The

Code
chapter
272
to
Code
section
256.16
(specific
criteria
21


for
teacher
preparation
and
certain

eliminates
a

reference
to
“professional
development
institution”
that
was
23


not
defined

used
elsewhere
in
