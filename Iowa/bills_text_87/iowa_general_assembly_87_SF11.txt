  1  1    Section 1.  MATERNAL HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR LOW=INCOME
  1  2 WOMEN.
  1  3    1.  a.  The department of human services, in cooperation
  1  4 with the division of insurance of the department of commerce,
  1  5 shall design a system that facilitates, seamlessly and with
  1  6 continuity for low=income women who qualify for Medicaid
  1  7 under the pregnancy=related coverage group, the transition to
  1  8 comprehensive public or private health care coverage in the
  1  9 postpartum period and beyond.  The department and the division
  1 10 shall cooperate to provide such women with information about
  1 11 and assistance with enrollment in the most appropriate coverage
  1 12 option.
  1 13    b.  The system shall include a process for a birthing
  1 14 hospital as defined in section 135.131 or an attending
  1 15 health care provider as defined in section 136A.2 to notify
  1 16 the department of human services following the birth of a
  1 17 child whose mother has pregnancy=related Medicaid coverage.
  1 18 Following notification of the department by the birthing
  1 19 hospital or attending health care provider, or, in the absence
  1 20 of such notification, on the first day of the month following
  1 21 the projected birth month of the child, the department shall
  1 22 notify the woman who has pregnancy=related Medicaid coverage
  1 23 that following the birth of the child she will be assigned to
  1 24 the postpartum coverage group and that her coverage will end
  1 25 sixty days postpartum.  The notice shall also inform the woman
  1 26 of the public and private health care coverage options for
  1 27 which the woman may be eligible, and that the department will
  1 28 assist in enrolling the woman in the most appropriate coverage.
  1 29 The process shall ensure that any continued health care
  1 30 coverage includes coverage of comprehensive maternal health
  1 31 services including but not limited to screening and treatment
  1 32 for postpartum depression and chronic conditions prevalent in
  1 33 women of child=bearing age.
  1 34    2.  The department of human services shall collaborate
  1 35 with Medicaid managed care organizations and Medicaid
  2  1 providers including  maternal and child health centers and
  2  2 other appropriate entities, to ensure that low=income women of
  2  3 child=bearing age are aware of health care coverage options and
  2  4 the need for health care coverage and care before, during, and
  2  5 after a pregnancy.  The department shall incorporate into any
  2  6 managed care organization contract a provision requiring the
  2  7 offering of incentives to recipients to comply with prenatal
  2  8 and postpartum care standards and requiring managed care
  2  9 organizations to provide prenatal and postpartum care managers.
  2 10    3.  The department of human services shall collaborate with
  2 11 the department of public health to coordinate their respective
  2 12 programs in providing comprehensive maternal health services.
  2 13 The department of public health shall incorporate into any
  2 14 maternal health program, including but not limited to healthy
  2 15 opportunities for parents to experience hope and the healthy
  2 16 families Iowa program, information regarding options for
  2 17 public and private health care coverage for low=income women
  2 18 of child=bearing age.  The department of human services and
  2 19 the department of public health shall utilize Medicaid program
  2 20 data, vital records data, and public health survey data to
  2 21 identify gaps in health care coverage, monitor outcomes, and
  2 22 inform policy to ensure the availability of comprehensive
  2 23 maternal health care coverage and care for low=income women of
  2 24 child=bearing age in the state.
  2 25                           EXPLANATION
  2 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 28    This bill relates to maternal health care coverage for
  2 29 low=income women.
  2 30    The bill directs the department of human services (DHS), in
  2 31 cooperation with the division of insurance of the department
  2 32 of commerce, to design a system that facilitates, seamlessly
  2 33 and with continuity for low=income women who qualify for
  2 34 Medicaid under the pregnancy=related coverage group, the
  2 35 transition to comprehensive public or private health care
  3  1 coverage during the postpartum period and beyond. DHS and the
  3  2 division of insurance are to cooperate to provide such women
  3  3 with information about and assistance with enrollment in the
  3  4 most appropriate coverage option.
  3  5    The system developed by DHS is also to include a process
  3  6 for a birthing hospital or an attending health care provider
  3  7 to notify DHS following the birth of a child whose mother
  3  8 has pregnancy=related Medicaid coverage. Following such
  3  9 notification or, in the absence of such notification, on the
  3 10 first day of the month following the projected birth month
  3 11 of the child, DHS is required to notify the woman who has
  3 12 pregnancy=related Medicaid coverage that following the birth of
  3 13 the child the woman will be assigned to the postpartum coverage
  3 14 group and that coverage will end 60 days postpartum.  The
  3 15 notice is also required to inform the woman of the public and
  3 16 private health care coverage options for which the woman may
  3 17 be eligible, and that DHS will assist in enrolling the woman
  3 18 in the most appropriate health care coverage. The process
  3 19 shall ensure that any continued health care coverage includes
  3 20 coverage of comprehensive maternal health services including
  3 21 but not limited to screening and treatment for postpartum
  3 22 depression and chronic conditions prevalent in women of
  3 23 child=bearing age.
  3 24    The bill also requires DHS to collaborate with Medicaid
  3 25 managed care organizations and Medicaid providers including
  3 26 maternal and child health centers and other appropriate
  3 27 entities to ensure that low=income women of child=bearing
  3 28 age are aware of health care coverage options and the need
  3 29 for health care coverage and care before, during, and after
  3 30 a pregnancy.  The department shall incorporate into any
  3 31 managed care organization contract a provision requiring the
  3 32 offering of incentives to encourage compliance of recipients
  3 33 with prenatal and postpartum care standards and requiring the
  3 34 managed care organizations to provide prenatal and postpartum
  3 35 care managers.
  4  1 The bill requires DHS to collaborate with the department of
  4  2 public health (DPH) to coordinate their respective programs
  4  3 in providing comprehensive maternal health services.  DPH is
  4  4 required to incorporate into any maternal health program,
  4  5 including but not limited to healthy opportunities for parents
  4  6 to experience hope and the healthy families Iowa program,
  4  7 information regarding options for public and private health
  4  8 care coverage for low=income women of child=bearing age.
  4  9 DHS and DPH are required to utilize Medicaid program data,
  4 10 vital records data, and public health survey data to identify
  4 11 gaps in maternal health care coverage, monitor outcomes, and
  4 12 inform policy to ensure the availability of comprehensive
  4 13 maternal health care coverage and care for low=income women of

  2 24 child=bearing age in the state.
  2 25                           EXPLANATION
  2 26 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 27 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 28    This bill relates to maternal health care coverage for
  2 29 low=income women.
  2 30    The bill directs the department of human services (DHS), in
  2 31 cooperation with the division of insurance of the department
  2 32 of commerce, to design a system that facilitates, seamlessly
  2 33 and with continuity for low=income women who qualify for
  2 34 Medicaid under the pregnancy=related coverage group, the
  2 35 transition to comprehensive public or private health care
  3  1 coverage during the postpartum period and beyond. DHS and the
  3  2 division of insurance are to cooperate to provide such women
  3  3 with information about and assistance with enrollment in the
  3  4 most appropriate coverage option.
  3  5    The system developed by DHS is also to include a process
  3  6 for a birthing hospital or an attending health care provider
  3  7 to notify DHS following the birth of a child whose mother
  3  8 has pregnancy=related Medicaid coverage. Following such
  3  9 notification or, in the absence of such notification, on the
  3 10 first day of the month following the projected birth month
  3 11 of the child, DHS is required to notify the woman who has
  3 12 pregnancy=related Medicaid coverage that following the birth of
  3 13 the child the woman will be assigned to the postpartum coverage
  3 14 group and that coverage will end 60 days postpartum.  The
  3 15 notice is also required to inform the woman of the public and
  3 16 private health care coverage options for which the woman may
  3 17 be eligible, and that DHS will assist in enrolling the woman
  3 18 in the most appropriate health care coverage. The process
  3 19 shall ensure that any continued health care coverage includes
  3 20 coverage of comprehensive maternal health services including
  3 21 but not limited to screening and treatment for postpartum
  3 22 depression and chronic conditions prevalent in women of
  3 23 child=bearing age.
  3 24    The bill also requires DHS to collaborate with Medicaid
  3 25 managed care organizations and Medicaid providers including
  3 26 maternal and child health centers and other appropriate
  3 27 entities to ensure that low=income women of child=bearing
  3 28 age are aware of health care coverage options and the need
  3 29 for health care coverage and care before, during, and after
  3 30 a pregnancy.  The department shall incorporate into any
  3 31 managed care organization contract a provision requiring the
  3 32 offering of incentives to encourage compliance of recipients
  3 33 with prenatal and postpartum care standards and requiring the
  3 34 managed care organizations to provide prenatal and postpartum
  3 35 care managers.
  4  1 The bill requires DHS to collaborate with the department of
  4  2 public health (DPH) to coordinate their respective programs
  4  3 in providing comprehensive maternal health services.  DPH is
  4  4 required to incorporate into any maternal health program,
  4  5 including but not limited to healthy opportunities for parents
  4  6 to experience hope and the healthy families Iowa program,
  4  7 information regarding options for public and private health
  4  8 care coverage for low=income women of child=bearing age.
  4  9 DHS and DPH are required to utilize Medicaid program data,
  4 10 vital records data, and public health survey data to identify
  4 11 gaps in maternal health care coverage, monitor outcomes, and
  4 12 inform policy to ensure the availability of comprehensive

  3  5    The system developed by DHS is also to include a process
  3  6 for a birthing hospital or an attending health care provider
  3  7 to notify DHS following the birth of a child whose mother
  3  8 has pregnancy=related Medicaid coverage. Following such
  3  9 notification or, in the absence of such notification, on the

  3 20 coverage of comprehensive maternal health services including
  3 21 but not limited to screening and treatment for postpartum
  3 22 depression and chronic conditions prevalent in women of
  3 23 child=bearing age.
  3 24    The bill also requires DHS to collaborate with Medicaid
  3 25 managed care organizations and Medicaid providers including
  3 26 maternal and child health centers and other appropriate
  3 27 entities to ensure that low=income women of child=bearing
  3 28 age are aware of health care coverage options and the need
  3 29 for health care coverage and care before, during, and after
  3 30 a pregnancy.  The department shall incorporate into any
  3 31 managed care organization contract a provision requiring the
  3 32 offering of incentives to encourage compliance of recipients
  3 33 with prenatal and postpartum care standards and requiring the
  3 34 managed care organizations to provide prenatal and postpartum
  3 35 care managers.
  4  1 The bill requires DHS to collaborate with the department of
  4  2 public health (DPH) to coordinate their respective programs
  4  3 in providing comprehensive maternal health services.  DPH is

  3  1 coverage during the postpartum period and beyond. DHS and the
  3  2 division of insurance are to cooperate to provide such women
  3  3 with information about and assistance with enrollment in the
  3  4 most appropriate coverage option.
  3  5    The system developed by DHS is also to include a process
  3  6 for a birthing hospital or an attending health care provider
  3  7 to notify DHS following the birth of a child whose mother
  3  8 has pregnancy=related Medicaid coverage. Following such
  3  9 notification or, in the absence of such notification, on the

  3 11 of the child, DHS is required to notify the woman who has
  3 12 pregnancy=related Medicaid coverage that following the birth of

  3 20 coverage of comprehensive maternal health services including
  3 21 but not limited to screening and treatment for postpartum
  3 22 depression and chronic conditions prevalent in women of
  3 23 child=bearing age.
  3 24    The bill also requires DHS to collaborate with Medicaid
  3 25 managed care organizations and Medicaid providers including
  3 26 maternal and child health centers and other appropriate
  3 27 entities to ensure that low=income women of child=bearing
  3 28 age are aware of health care coverage options and the need
  3 29 for health care coverage and care before, during, and after
  3 30 a pregnancy.  The department shall incorporate into any
  3 31 managed care organization contract a provision requiring the
  3 32 offering of incentives to encourage compliance of recipients
  3 33 with prenatal and postpartum care standards and requiring the
  3 34 managed care organizations to provide prenatal and postpartum

  2 30    The bill directs the department of human services (DHS), in
  2 31 cooperation with the division of insurance of the department
  2 32 of commerce, to design a system that facilitates, seamlessly
  2 33 and with continuity for low=income women who qualify for
  2 34 Medicaid under the pregnancy=related coverage group, the
  2 35 transition to comprehensive public or private health care
  3  1 coverage during the postpartum period and beyond. DHS and the
  3  2 division of insurance are to cooperate to provide such women
  3  3 with information about and assistance with enrollment in the
  3  4 most appropriate coverage option.
  3  5    The system developed by DHS is also to include a process
  3  6 for a birthing hospital or an attending health care provider
  3  7 to notify DHS following the birth of a child whose mother
  3  8 has pregnancy=related Medicaid coverage. Following such
  3  9 notification or, in the absence of such notification, on the
  3 10 first day of the month following the projected birth month
  3 11 of the child, DHS is required to notify the woman who has
  3 12 pregnancy=related Medicaid coverage that following the birth of
  3 13 the child the woman will be assigned to the postpartum coverage
  3 14 group and that coverage will end 60 days postpartum.  The
  3 15 notice is also required to inform the woman of the public and
  3 16 private health care coverage options for which the woman may
  3 17 be eligible, and that DHS will assist in enrolling the woman
  3 18 in the most appropriate health care coverage. The process
  3 19 shall ensure that any continued health care coverage includes
  3 20 coverage of comprehensive maternal health services including
  3 21 but not limited to screening and treatment for postpartum
  3 22 depression and chronic conditions prevalent in women of
  3 23 child=bearing age.
  3 24    The bill also requires DHS to collaborate with Medicaid
  3 25 managed care organizations and Medicaid providers including
  3 26 maternal and child health centers and other appropriate
  3 27 entities to ensure that low=income women of child=bearing
  3 28 age are aware of health care coverage options and the need
  3 29 for health care coverage and care before, during, and after
  3 30 a pregnancy.  The department shall incorporate into any
  3 31 managed care organization contract a provision requiring the
  3 32 offering of incentives to encourage compliance of recipients
  3 33 with prenatal and postpartum care standards and requiring the
  3 34 managed care organizations to provide prenatal and postpartum
