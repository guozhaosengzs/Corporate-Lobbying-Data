 18 31                           EXPLANATION
 18 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 34    OVERVIEW.  This bill creates the "Iowa Industrial Hemp Act"
 18 35 authorizing the production and marketing of industrial hemp
 19  1 as part of an industrial hemp commodity program administered
 19  2 by the department of agriculture and land stewardship and an
 19  3 industrial hemp production program administered by one or
 19  4 more regents institutions (Iowa state university of science
 19  5 and technology, the university of Iowa, or the university of
 19  6 northern Iowa) acting in cooperation with the department.
 19  7 According to the bill, industrial hemp refers to the plant
 19  8 classified as Cannabis sativa (plant) having a concentration of
 19  9 delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) not to exceed three=tenths
 19 10 of 1 percent according to tests conducted by a laboratory
 19 11 approved by the department.  The bill also provides that the
 19 12 two programs are established for the exclusive purpose of
 19 13 growing, cultivating, and marketing industrial hemp in a manner
 19 14 that complies with the programs and projects described in 7
 19 15 U.S.C. {5940.
 19 16    FEDERAL LAW.  The purpose of the programs is to determine
 19 17 the commercial viability of industrial hemp as described in
 19 18 federal legislation, section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of
 19 19 2014 (7 U.S.C. {5940), which legalizes the possession and
 19 20 use of industrial hemp if regulated by a state department of
 19 21 agriculture administering a pilot program.  The federal law
 19 22 also authorizes an institution of higher education (registrant)
 19 23 to produce industrial hemp in order to advance academic
 19 24 research.  The federal law does not authorize a federal agency
 19 25 to implement or oversee the program.  However, it also does
 19 26 not expressly supersede other federal laws that restrict items
 19 27 designated as controlled substances including the federal
 19 28 "Controlled Substances Import and Export Act" (21 U.S.C. {951
 19 29 et seq.), requiring that cannabis seeds capable of germination
 19 30 only be imported into a state by persons registered with the
 19 31 drug enforcement administration of the United States department
 19 32 of justice (DEA).
 19 33    IOWA'S UNIFORM CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT.  A person who
 19 34 produces industrial hemp under one of the two programs is
 19 35 exempted from state criminal law included in the "Uniform
 20  1 Controlled Substances Act" (Code chapter 124) which prohibits
 20  2 persons from knowingly or intentionally possessing a controlled
 20  3 substance (Code section 124.401) including the plant referred
 20  4 to as marijuana included as a schedule I controlled substance
 20  5 (Code section 124.204).  "Marijuana" includes all parts of
 20  6 the plant without regard to THC concentration (Code section
 20  7 124.101).
 20  8    GENERAL == PARTICIPATION IN A PROGRAM REQUIRED.  A person
 20  9 is prohibited from producing, handling, transporting,
 20 10 marketing, or processing industrial hemp in this state unless
 20 11 the industrial hemp has been produced under one of the two
 20 12 programs.  There is no prohibition for marketing an industrial
 20 13 hemp product.
 20 14    GENERAL == TESTING.  In order to qualify as industrial hemp,
 20 15 the maximum concentration of delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol
 20 16 present in the plant cannot exceed three=tenths of 1 percent
 20 17 as analyzed on a dry weight basis.  During production (from
 20 18 planting to harvest), a crop must be tested by a qualified
 20 19 public or private laboratory approved by the department.  A
 20 20 licensee must test the crop as required by the department or
 20 21 registrant.  The department or registrant may test a crop under
 20 22 its program.  In any case, a test must be conducted 30 days
 20 23 prior to harvest.
 20 24    ADMINISTRATION == COUNCIL, DEPARTMENT, AND REGISTRANTS.
 20 25  An industrial hemp council is created comprised of private
 20 26 and public members, including employees of the department,
 20 27 the department of natural resources, the department of public
 20 28 safety, and a regents institution registrant (or Iowa state
 20 29 university of science and technology until a university is
 20 30 registered).  The council also includes four legislative
 20 31 members.  The council is to advise the department and the
 20 32 registrant regarding the administration and enforcement of the
 20 33 bill, including the two programs, the issuance of licenses,
 20 34 and the selection of program participants, the importation
 20 35 and certification of seed, the generation of revenue from the
 21  1 sale of seed and fees, and enforcement actions taken against
 21  2 licensees.  The council is also responsible for preparing
 21  3 an annual report regarding the success of the programs for
 21  4 submission to the governor and general assembly.
 21  5    ADMINISTRATION == PROGRAMS.  Under the industrial hemp
 21  6 commodity program, industrial hemp must be produced by a person
 21  7 licensed by the department, and under the industrial hemp
 21  8 production program, industrial hemp must be produced either by
 21  9 the registrant or by a licensee selected by the registrant.
 21 10 The bill also provides for requirements for the selection of
 21 11 licensees to participate in a program, including the processing
 21 12 of applications for licenses, the terms and conditions of
 21 13 a contract to participate in an industrial hemp production
 21 14 program, the inspection of a licensee's records, the inspection
 21 15 of a licensee's facilities, and testing of the licensee's crop.
 21 16    ADMINISTRATION == CERTIFICATION AND SALE OF SEED.  The
 21 17 department is responsible for certifying industrial hemp seed
 21 18 capable of germination.  Either the department or a registrant
 21 19 may obtain authorization by DEA to import seed for departmental
 21 20 certification and either administrative entity may sell the
 21 21 seed to the other entity or a licensee participating in one of
 21 22 the programs.
 21 23    FINANCE == MONEYS COLLECTED AND EXPENDED BY THE
 21 24 ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITIES.  Moneys collected from the sale of
 21 25 seed are retained by either the department or the registrant
 21 26 acting as the seller and must be used to administer their
 21 27 respective programs.   Each administrative entity may also
 21 28 collect fees associated with administering their program and
 21 29 regulating licensees.  These fees include an application
 21 30 fee, licensee fee, inspection fee, and laboratory fee.  The
 21 31 amount of the fee must be based on an estimate of expenses
 21 32 necessary to administer the administrative entity's program.
 21 33 Moneys collected by the department from certified seed sales
 21 34 and fees must be deposited into an industrial hemp commodity
 21 35 fund which are appropriated to the department to administer
 22  1 its program.  Moneys paid to a registrant are retained by the
 22  2 registrant and treated as repayment receipts for costs incurred
 22  3 in administering its program.
 22  4    ENFORCEMENT == COOPERATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC
 22  5 SAFETY.  The department and a registrant must cooperate with
 22  6 the department of public safety in administering and enforcing
 22  7 the provisions of the bill.
 22  8    ENFORCEMENT == CONFISCATION.  If a licensee produces
 22  9 a plant exceeding the maximum allowed concentration of
 22 10 delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol, the plant must be confiscated
 22 11 and destroyed by the department or registrant supervising
 22 12 production and with assistance by the department of public
 22 13 safety or a local law enforcement authority.
 22 14    ENFORCEMENT == DISCIPLINARY ACTION.  The department may
 22 15 suspend or revoke a person's license for providing false
 22 16 or misleading information on an application prior to being
 22 17 selected or to the department or a registrant after being
 22 18 selected.  The department may also suspend or revoke a license
 22 19 for failing to comply with a program requirement as set forth
 22 20 in statute, a rule adopted by the department, or an industrial
 22 21 hemp production contract.
 22 22    ENFORCEMENT == CIVIL PENALTIES.  A person who violates a
 22 23 provision of the bill is subject to a civil penalty of not less
 22 24 than $500 and not more than $2,500 as assessed and collected by
 22 25 the department.  Each day that a continuing violation occurs
 22 26 is considered a separate offense.  The department is required
 22 27 to establish a schedule of civil penalties for violations.
 22 28 A civil penalty cannot be imposed against a licensee for a
 22 29 violation that results in the confiscation and destruction of
 22 30 the licensee's crop unless the composite test result for the
 22 31 crop is a concentration greater than 2 percent.
 22 32    ENFORCEMENT == CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A person who knowingly
 22 33 or intentionally produces the plant and who is not the
 22 34 department, a registrant, or a licensee participating in a
 22 35 program is subject to the criminal penalties described in Code
 23  1 chapters 124 and 453B.  A person who knowingly or intentionally
 23  2 possesses marijuana as a first offense is punishable by
 23  3 imprisonment in the county jail for not more than six months or
 23  4 by a fine of not more than $1,000 (Code section 124.401).  For a
 23  5 second offense, the person is guilty of a serious misdemeanor,
 23  6 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 23  7 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.  For a third or
 23  8 subsequent offense, the person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 23  9 punishable by confinement for no more than five years and a
 23 10 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500. A person acting
 23 11 in violation of Code chapter 453B for failing to pay an excise
 23 12 tax on the sale of marijuana (Code section 453B.7) is also
 23 13 guilty of a class "D" felony (Code section 453B.12).

 18 28 of those universities in administering an industrial hemp
 18 29 production program in cooperation with the department of
 18 30 agriculture and land stewardship as provided in chapter 188.
 18 31                           EXPLANATION
 18 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 34    OVERVIEW.  This bill creates the "Iowa Industrial Hemp Act"
 18 35 authorizing the production and marketing of industrial hemp
 19  1 as part of an industrial hemp commodity program administered
 19  2 by the department of agriculture and land stewardship and an
 19  3 industrial hemp production program administered by one or
 19  4 more regents institutions (Iowa state university of science
 19  5 and technology, the university of Iowa, or the university of
 19  6 northern Iowa) acting in cooperation with the department.
 19  7 According to the bill, industrial hemp refers to the plant
 19  8 classified as Cannabis sativa (plant) having a concentration of
 19  9 delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) not to exceed three=tenths
 19 10 of 1 percent according to tests conducted by a laboratory
 19 11 approved by the department.  The bill also provides that the
 19 12 two programs are established for the exclusive purpose of
 19 13 growing, cultivating, and marketing industrial hemp in a manner
 19 14 that complies with the programs and projects described in 7
 19 15 U.S.C. {5940.
 19 16    FEDERAL LAW.  The purpose of the programs is to determine
 19 17 the commercial viability of industrial hemp as described in
 19 18 federal legislation, section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of
 19 19 2014 (7 U.S.C. {5940), which legalizes the possession and
 19 20 use of industrial hemp if regulated by a state department of
 19 21 agriculture administering a pilot program.  The federal law
 19 22 also authorizes an institution of higher education (registrant)
 19 23 to produce industrial hemp in order to advance academic
 19 24 research.  The federal law does not authorize a federal agency
 19 25 to implement or oversee the program.  However, it also does
 19 26 not expressly supersede other federal laws that restrict items
 19 27 designated as controlled substances including the federal
 19 28 "Controlled Substances Import and Export Act" (21 U.S.C. {951
 19 29 et seq.), requiring that cannabis seeds capable of germination
 19 30 only be imported into a state by persons registered with the
 19 31 drug enforcement administration of the United States department
 19 32 of justice (DEA).
 19 33    IOWA'S UNIFORM CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT.  A person who
 19 34 produces industrial hemp under one of the two programs is
 19 35 exempted from state criminal law included in the "Uniform
 20  1 Controlled Substances Act" (Code chapter 124) which prohibits
 20  2 persons from knowingly or intentionally possessing a controlled
 20  3 substance (Code section 124.401) including the plant referred
 20  4 to as marijuana included as a schedule I controlled substance
 20  5 (Code section 124.204).  "Marijuana" includes all parts of
 20  6 the plant without regard to THC concentration (Code section
 20  7 124.101).
 20  8    GENERAL == PARTICIPATION IN A PROGRAM REQUIRED.  A person
 20  9 is prohibited from producing, handling, transporting,
 20 10 marketing, or processing industrial hemp in this state unless
 20 11 the industrial hemp has been produced under one of the two
 20 12 programs.  There is no prohibition for marketing an industrial
 20 13 hemp product.
 20 14    GENERAL == TESTING.  In order to qualify as industrial hemp,
 20 15 the maximum concentration of delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol
 20 16 present in the plant cannot exceed three=tenths of 1 percent
 20 17 as analyzed on a dry weight basis.  During production (from
 20 18 planting to harvest), a crop must be tested by a qualified
 20 19 public or private laboratory approved by the department.  A
 20 20 licensee must test the crop as required by the department or
 20 21 registrant.  The department or registrant may test a crop under
 20 22 its program.  In any case, a test must be conducted 30 days
 20 23 prior to harvest.
 20 24    ADMINISTRATION == COUNCIL, DEPARTMENT, AND REGISTRANTS.
 20 25  An industrial hemp council is created comprised of private
 20 26 and public members, including employees of the department,
 20 27 the department of natural resources, the department of public
 20 28 safety, and a regents institution registrant (or Iowa state
 20 29 university of science and technology until a university is
 20 30 registered).  The council also includes four legislative
 20 31 members.  The council is to advise the department and the
 20 32 registrant regarding the administration and enforcement of the
 20 33 bill, including the two programs, the issuance of licenses,
 20 34 and the selection of program participants, the importation
 20 35 and certification of seed, the generation of revenue from the
 21  1 sale of seed and fees, and enforcement actions taken against
 21  2 licensees.  The council is also responsible for preparing
 21  3 an annual report regarding the success of the programs for
 21  4 submission to the governor and general assembly.
 21  5    ADMINISTRATION == PROGRAMS.  Under the industrial hemp
 21  6 commodity program, industrial hemp must be produced by a person
 21  7 licensed by the department, and under the industrial hemp
 21  8 production program, industrial hemp must be produced either by
 21  9 the registrant or by a licensee selected by the registrant.
 21 10 The bill also provides for requirements for the selection of
 21 11 licensees to participate in a program, including the processing
 21 12 of applications for licenses, the terms and conditions of
 21 13 a contract to participate in an industrial hemp production
 21 14 program, the inspection of a licensee's records, the inspection
 21 15 of a licensee's facilities, and testing of the licensee's crop.
 21 16    ADMINISTRATION == CERTIFICATION AND SALE OF SEED.  The
 21 17 department is responsible for certifying industrial hemp seed
 21 18 capable of germination.  Either the department or a registrant
 21 19 may obtain authorization by DEA to import seed for departmental
 21 20 certification and either administrative entity may sell the
 21 21 seed to the other entity or a licensee participating in one of
 21 22 the programs.
 21 23    FINANCE == MONEYS COLLECTED AND EXPENDED BY THE
 21 24 ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITIES.  Moneys collected from the sale of
 21 25 seed are retained by either the department or the registrant
 21 26 acting as the seller and must be used to administer their
 21 27 respective programs.   Each administrative entity may also
 21 28 collect fees associated with administering their program and
 21 29 regulating licensees.  These fees include an application
 21 30 fee, licensee fee, inspection fee, and laboratory fee.  The
 21 31 amount of the fee must be based on an estimate of expenses
 21 32 necessary to administer the administrative entity's program.
 21 33 Moneys collected by the department from certified seed sales
 21 34 and fees must be deposited into an industrial hemp commodity
 21 35 fund which are appropriated to the department to administer
 22  1 its program.  Moneys paid to a registrant are retained by the
 22  2 registrant and treated as repayment receipts for costs incurred
 22  3 in administering its program.
 22  4    ENFORCEMENT == COOPERATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC
 22  5 SAFETY.  The department and a registrant must cooperate with
 22  6 the department of public safety in administering and enforcing
 22  7 the provisions of the bill.
 22  8    ENFORCEMENT == CONFISCATION.  If a licensee produces
 22  9 a plant exceeding the maximum allowed concentration of
 22 10 delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol, the plant must be confiscated
 22 11 and destroyed by the department or registrant supervising
 22 12 production and with assistance by the department of public
 22 13 safety or a local law enforcement authority.
 22 14    ENFORCEMENT == DISCIPLINARY ACTION.  The department may
 22 15 suspend or revoke a person's license for providing false
 22 16 or misleading information on an application prior to being
 22 17 selected or to the department or a registrant after being
 22 18 selected.  The department may also suspend or revoke a license
 22 19 for failing to comply with a program requirement as set forth
 22 20 in statute, a rule adopted by the department, or an industrial
 22 21 hemp production contract.
 22 22    ENFORCEMENT == CIVIL PENALTIES.  A person who violates a
 22 23 provision of the bill is subject to a civil penalty of not less
 22 24 than $500 and not more than $2,500 as assessed and collected by
 22 25 the department.  Each day that a continuing violation occurs
 22 26 is considered a separate offense.  The department is required
 22 27 to establish a schedule of civil penalties for violations.
 22 28 A civil penalty cannot be imposed against a licensee for a
 22 29 violation that results in the confiscation and destruction of
 22 30 the licensee's crop unless the composite test result for the
 22 31 crop is a concentration greater than 2 percent.
 22 32    ENFORCEMENT == CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A person who knowingly
 22 33 or intentionally produces the plant and who is not the
 22 34 department, a registrant, or a licensee participating in a
 22 35 program is subject to the criminal penalties described in Code
 23  1 chapters 124 and 453B.  A person who knowingly or intentionally
 23  2 possesses marijuana as a first offense is punishable by
 23  3 imprisonment in the county jail for not more than six months or
 23  4 by a fine of not more than $1,000 (Code section 124.401).  For a
 23  5 second offense, the person is guilty of a serious misdemeanor,
 23  6 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 23  7 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.  For a third or

 18 31                           EXPLANATION
 18 32 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 33 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 34    OVERVIEW.  This bill creates the "Iowa Industrial Hemp Act"
 18 35 authorizing the production and marketing of industrial hemp
 19  1 as part of an industrial hemp commodity program administered
 19  2 by the department of agriculture and land stewardship and an
 19  3 industrial hemp production program administered by one or
 19  4 more regents institutions (Iowa state university of science
 19  5 and technology, the university of Iowa, or the university of
 19  6 northern Iowa) acting in cooperation with the department.
 19  7 According to the bill, industrial hemp refers to the plant
 19  8 classified as Cannabis sativa (plant) having a concentration of
 19  9 delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) not to exceed three=tenths
 19 10 of 1 percent according to tests conducted by a laboratory
 19 11 approved by the department.  The bill also provides that the
 19 12 two programs are established for the exclusive purpose of
 19 13 growing, cultivating, and marketing industrial hemp in a manner
 19 14 that complies with the programs and projects described in 7
 19 15 U.S.C. {5940.
 19 16    FEDERAL LAW.  The purpose of the programs is to determine
 19 17 the commercial viability of industrial hemp as described in
 19 18 federal legislation, section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of
 19 19 2014 (7 U.S.C. {5940), which legalizes the possession and
 19 20 use of industrial hemp if regulated by a state department of
 19 21 agriculture administering a pilot program.  The federal law
 19 22 also authorizes an institution of higher education (registrant)
 19 23 to produce industrial hemp in order to advance academic
 19 24 research.  The federal law does not authorize a federal agency
 19 25 to implement or oversee the program.  However, it also does
 19 26 not expressly supersede other federal laws that restrict items
 19 27 designated as controlled substances including the federal
 19 28 "Controlled Substances Import and Export Act" (21 U.S.C. {951
 19 29 et seq.), requiring that cannabis seeds capable of germination
 19 30 only be imported into a state by persons registered with the
 19 31 drug enforcement administration of the United States department
 19 32 of justice (DEA).
 19 33    IOWA'S UNIFORM CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT.  A person who
 19 34 produces industrial hemp under one of the two programs is
 19 35 exempted from state criminal law included in the "Uniform
 20  1 Controlled Substances Act" (Code chapter 124) which prohibits
 20  2 persons from knowingly or intentionally possessing a controlled
 20  3 substance (Code section 124.401) including the plant referred
 20  4 to as marijuana included as a schedule I controlled substance
 20  5 (Code section 124.204).  "Marijuana" includes all parts of
 20  6 the plant without regard to THC concentration (Code section
 20  7 124.101).
 20  8    GENERAL == PARTICIPATION IN A PROGRAM REQUIRED.  A person
 20  9 is prohibited from producing, handling, transporting,
 20 10 marketing, or processing industrial hemp in this state unless
 20 11 the industrial hemp has been produced under one of the two
 20 12 programs.  There is no prohibition for marketing an industrial
 20 13 hemp product.
 20 14    GENERAL == TESTING.  In order to qualify as industrial hemp,
 20 15 the maximum concentration of delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol
 20 16 present in the plant cannot exceed three=tenths of 1 percent
 20 17 as analyzed on a dry weight basis.  During production (from
 20 18 planting to harvest), a crop must be tested by a qualified
 20 19 public or private laboratory approved by the department.  A
 20 20 licensee must test the crop as required by the department or
 20 21 registrant.  The department or registrant may test a crop under
 20 22 its program.  In any case, a test must be conducted 30 days
 20 23 prior to harvest.
 20 24    ADMINISTRATION == COUNCIL, DEPARTMENT, AND REGISTRANTS.
 20 25  An industrial hemp council is created comprised of private
 20 26 and public members, including employees of the department,
 20 27 the department of natural resources, the department of public
 20 28 safety, and a regents institution registrant (or Iowa state
 20 29 university of science and technology until a university is
 20 30 registered).  The council also includes four legislative
 20 31 members.  The council is to advise the department and the
 20 32 registrant regarding the administration and enforcement of the
 20 33 bill, including the two programs, the issuance of licenses,
 20 34 and the selection of program participants, the importation
 20 35 and certification of seed, the generation of revenue from the
 21  1 sale of seed and fees, and enforcement actions taken against
 21  2 licensees.  The council is also responsible for preparing
 21  3 an annual report regarding the success of the programs for
 21  4 submission to the governor and general assembly.

 21 22 the programs.
 21 23    FINANCE == MONEYS COLLECTED AND EXPENDED BY THE
 21 24 ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITIES.  Moneys collected from the sale of
 21 25 seed are retained by either the department or the registrant
 21 26 acting as the seller and must be used to administer their
 21 27 respective programs.   Each administrative entity may also
 21 28 collect fees associated with administering their program and
 21 29 regulating licensees.  These fees include an application
 21 30 fee, licensee fee, inspection fee, and laboratory fee.  The
 21 31 amount of the fee must be based on an estimate of expenses
 21 32 necessary to administer the administrative entity's program.
 21 33 Moneys collected by the department from certified seed sales
 21 34 and fees must be deposited into an industrial hemp commodity
 21 35 fund which are appropriated to the department to administer
 22  1 its program.  Moneys paid to a registrant are retained by the
 22  2 registrant and treated as repayment receipts for costs incurred
 22  3 in administering its program.

 19  4 more regents institutions (Iowa state university of science
 19  5 and technology, the university of Iowa, or the university of
 19  6 northern Iowa) acting in cooperation with the department.
 19  7 According to the bill, industrial hemp refers to the plant
 19  8 classified as Cannabis sativa (plant) having a concentration of
 19  9 delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) not to exceed three=tenths
 19 10 of 1 percent according to tests conducted by a laboratory
 19 11 approved by the department.  The bill also provides that the
 19 12 two programs are established for the exclusive purpose of
 19 13 growing, cultivating, and marketing industrial hemp in a manner
 19 14 that complies with the programs and projects described in 7
 19 15 U.S.C. {5940.
 19 16    FEDERAL LAW.  The purpose of the programs is to determine
 19 17 the commercial viability of industrial hemp as described in
 19 18 federal legislation, section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of
 19 19 2014 (7 U.S.C. {5940), which legalizes the possession and
 19 20 use of industrial hemp if regulated by a state department of
 19 21 agriculture administering a pilot program.  The federal law
 19 22 also authorizes an institution of higher education (registrant)
 19 23 to produce industrial hemp in order to advance academic
 19 24 research.  The federal law does not authorize a federal agency
 19 25 to implement or oversee the program.  However, it also does
 19 26 not expressly supersede other federal laws that restrict items
 19 27 designated as controlled substances including the federal
 19 28 "Controlled Substances Import and Export Act" (21 U.S.C. {951
 19 29 et seq.), requiring that cannabis seeds capable of germination
 19 30 only be imported into a state by persons registered with the
 19 31 drug enforcement administration of the United States department
 19 32 of justice (DEA).
 19 33    IOWA'S UNIFORM CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT.  A person who
 19 34 produces industrial hemp under one of the two programs is
 19 35 exempted from state criminal law included in the "Uniform
 20  1 Controlled Substances Act" (Code chapter 124) which prohibits
 20  2 persons from knowingly or intentionally possessing a controlled
 20  3 substance (Code section 124.401) including the plant referred
 20  4 to as marijuana included as a schedule I controlled substance

 20 12 programs.  There is no prohibition for marketing an industrial
 20 13 hemp product.
 20 14    GENERAL == TESTING.  In order to qualify as industrial hemp,
 20 15 the maximum concentration of delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol
 20 16 present in the plant cannot exceed three=tenths of 1 percent
 20 17 as analyzed on a dry weight basis.  During production (from
 20 18 planting to harvest), a crop must be tested by a qualified
 20 19 public or private laboratory approved by the department.  A
 20 20 licensee must test the crop as required by the department or
 20 21 registrant.  The department or registrant may test a crop under
 20 22 its program.  In any case, a test must be conducted 30 days
 20 23 prior to harvest.
 20 24    ADMINISTRATION == COUNCIL, DEPARTMENT, AND REGISTRANTS.
 20 25  An industrial hemp council is created comprised of private

 18 34    OVERVIEW.  This bill creates the "Iowa Industrial Hemp Act"
 18 35 authorizing the production and marketing of industrial hemp
 19  1 as part of an industrial hemp commodity program administered
 19  2 by the department of agriculture and land stewardship and an
 19  3 industrial hemp production program administered by one or
 19  4 more regents institutions (Iowa state university of science
 19  5 and technology, the university of Iowa, or the university of
 19  6 northern Iowa) acting in cooperation with the department.
 19  7 According to the bill, industrial hemp refers to the plant
 19  8 classified as Cannabis sativa (plant) having a concentration of
 19  9 delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) not to exceed three=tenths
 19 10 of 1 percent according to tests conducted by a laboratory
 19 11 approved by the department.  The bill also provides that the
 19 12 two programs are established for the exclusive purpose of
 19 13 growing, cultivating, and marketing industrial hemp in a manner
 19 14 that complies with the programs and projects described in 7
 19 15 U.S.C. {5940.
 19 16    FEDERAL LAW.  The purpose of the programs is to determine
 19 17 the commercial viability of industrial hemp as described in
 19 18 federal legislation, section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of
 19 19 2014 (7 U.S.C. {5940), which legalizes the possession and
 19 20 use of industrial hemp if regulated by a state department of
 19 21 agriculture administering a pilot program.  The federal law
 19 22 also authorizes an institution of higher education (registrant)
 19 23 to produce industrial hemp in order to advance academic
 19 24 research.  The federal law does not authorize a federal agency
 19 25 to implement or oversee the program.  However, it also does
 19 26 not expressly supersede other federal laws that restrict items
 19 27 designated as controlled substances including the federal
 19 28 "Controlled Substances Import and Export Act" (21 U.S.C. {951
 19 29 et seq.), requiring that cannabis seeds capable of germination
 19 30 only be imported into a state by persons registered with the
 19 31 drug enforcement administration of the United States department
 19 32 of justice (DEA).
 19 33    IOWA'S UNIFORM CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT.  A person who
 19 34 produces industrial hemp under one of the two programs is
 19 35 exempted from state criminal law included in the "Uniform
 20  1 Controlled Substances Act" (Code chapter 124) which prohibits
 20  2 persons from knowingly or intentionally possessing a controlled
 20  3 substance (Code section 124.401) including the plant referred
 20  4 to as marijuana included as a schedule I controlled substance
 20  5 (Code section 124.204).  "Marijuana" includes all parts of
 20  6 the plant without regard to THC concentration (Code section
 20  7 124.101).
 20  8    GENERAL == PARTICIPATION IN A PROGRAM REQUIRED.  A person
 20  9 is prohibited from producing, handling, transporting,
 20 10 marketing, or processing industrial hemp in this state unless
 20 11 the industrial hemp has been produced under one of the two
 20 12 programs.  There is no prohibition for marketing an industrial
 20 13 hemp product.
 20 14    GENERAL == TESTING.  In order to qualify as industrial hemp,
 20 15 the maximum concentration of delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol
 20 16 present in the plant cannot exceed three=tenths of 1 percent
 20 17 as analyzed on a dry weight basis.  During production (from
 20 18 planting to harvest), a crop must be tested by a qualified
 20 19 public or private laboratory approved by the department.  A
 20 20 licensee must test the crop as required by the department or
 20 21 registrant.  The department or registrant may test a crop under
 20 22 its program.  In any case, a test must be conducted 30 days
 20 23 prior to harvest.
 20 24    ADMINISTRATION == COUNCIL, DEPARTMENT, AND REGISTRANTS.
 20 25  An industrial hemp council is created comprised of private
 20 26 and public members, including employees of the department,
 20 27 the department of natural resources, the department of public
 20 28 safety, and a regents institution registrant (or Iowa state
 20 29 university of science and technology until a university is
 20 30 registered).  The council also includes four legislative
 20 31 members.  The council is to advise the department and the
 20 32 registrant regarding the administration and enforcement of the
 20 33 bill, including the two programs, the issuance of licenses,
 20 34 and the selection of program participants, the importation
 20 35 and certification of seed, the generation of revenue from the
 21  1 sale of seed and fees, and enforcement actions taken against
 21  2 licensees.  The council is also responsible for preparing

 21  6 commodity program, industrial hemp must be produced by a person
 21  7 licensed by the department, and under the industrial hemp
 21  8 production program, industrial hemp must be produced either by
 21  9 the registrant or by a licensee selected by the registrant.
 21 10 The bill also provides for requirements for the selection of
 21 11 licensees to participate in a program, including the processing
 21 12 of applications for licenses, the terms and conditions of
 21 13 a contract to participate in an industrial hemp production
 21 14 program, the inspection of a licensee's records, the inspection

 21 26 acting as the seller and must be used to administer their
 21 27 respective programs.   Each administrative entity may also
 21 28 collect fees associated with administering their program and
 21 29 regulating licensees.  These fees include an application
 21 30 fee, licensee fee, inspection fee, and laboratory fee.  The
 21 31 amount of the fee must be based on an estimate of expenses
 21 32 necessary to administer the administrative entity's program.
 21 33 Moneys collected by the department from certified seed sales
 21 34 and fees must be deposited into an industrial hemp commodity
 21 35 fund which are appropriated to the department to administer

 19  7 According to the bill, industrial hemp refers to the plant
 19  8 classified as Cannabis sativa (plant) having a concentration of
 19  9 delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) not to exceed three=tenths
 19 10 of 1 percent according to tests conducted by a laboratory
 19 11 approved by the department.  The bill also provides that the
 19 12 two programs are established for the exclusive purpose of
 19 13 growing, cultivating, and marketing industrial hemp in a manner
 19 14 that complies with the programs and projects described in 7
 19 15 U.S.C. {5940.
 19 16    FEDERAL LAW.  The purpose of the programs is to determine
 19 17 the commercial viability of industrial hemp as described in
 19 18 federal legislation, section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of
 19 19 2014 (7 U.S.C. {5940), which legalizes the possession and
 19 20 use of industrial hemp if regulated by a state department of
 19 21 agriculture administering a pilot program.  The federal law
 19 22 also authorizes an institution of higher education (registrant)
 19 23 to produce industrial hemp in order to advance academic
 19 24 research.  The federal law does not authorize a federal agency
 19 25 to implement or oversee the program.  However, it also does
 19 26 not expressly supersede other federal laws that restrict items
 19 27 designated as controlled substances including the federal
 19 28 "Controlled Substances Import and Export Act" (21 U.S.C. {951
 19 29 et seq.), requiring that cannabis seeds capable of germination
 19 30 only be imported into a state by persons registered with the

 19  7 According to the bill, industrial hemp refers to the plant
 19  8 classified as Cannabis sativa (plant) having a concentration of
 19  9 delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) not to exceed three=tenths
 19 10 of 1 percent according to tests conducted by a laboratory
 19 11 approved by the department.  The bill also provides that the
 19 12 two programs are established for the exclusive purpose of
 19 13 growing, cultivating, and marketing industrial hemp in a manner
 19 14 that complies with the programs and projects described in 7
 19 15 U.S.C. {5940.
 19 16    FEDERAL LAW.  The purpose of the programs is to determine
 19 17 the commercial viability of industrial hemp as described in
 19 18 federal legislation, section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of
 19 19 2014 (7 U.S.C. {5940), which legalizes the possession and
 19 20 use of industrial hemp if regulated by a state department of
 19 21 agriculture administering a pilot program.  The federal law
 19 22 also authorizes an institution of higher education (registrant)
 19 23 to produce industrial hemp in order to advance academic
 19 24 research.  The federal law does not authorize a federal agency
 19 25 to implement or oversee the program.  However, it also does
 19 26 not expressly supersede other federal laws that restrict items
 19 27 designated as controlled substances including the federal
 19 28 "Controlled Substances Import and Export Act" (21 U.S.C. {951
 19 29 et seq.), requiring that cannabis seeds capable of germination
 19 30 only be imported into a state by persons registered with the
 19 31 drug enforcement administration of the United States department
 19 32 of justice (DEA).
 19 33    IOWA'S UNIFORM CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT.  A person who
 19 34 produces industrial hemp under one of the two programs is
 19 35 exempted from state criminal law included in the "Uniform
 20  1 Controlled Substances Act" (Code chapter 124) which prohibits
 20  2 persons from knowingly or intentionally possessing a controlled
 20  3 substance (Code section 124.401) including the plant referred
 20  4 to as marijuana included as a schedule I controlled substance
 20  5 (Code section 124.204).  "Marijuana" includes all parts of
 20  6 the plant without regard to THC concentration (Code section
 20  7 124.101).
 20  8    GENERAL == PARTICIPATION IN A PROGRAM REQUIRED.  A person
 20  9 is prohibited from producing, handling, transporting,
 20 10 marketing, or processing industrial hemp in this state unless
 20 11 the industrial hemp has been produced under one of the two
 20 12 programs.  There is no prohibition for marketing an industrial
 20 13 hemp product.
 20 14    GENERAL == TESTING.  In order to qualify as industrial hemp,
 20 15 the maximum concentration of delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol
 20 16 present in the plant cannot exceed three=tenths of 1 percent
 20 17 as analyzed on a dry weight basis.  During production (from
 20 18 planting to harvest), a crop must be tested by a qualified
 20 19 public or private laboratory approved by the department.  A
 20 20 licensee must test the crop as required by the department or
 20 21 registrant.  The department or registrant may test a crop under
 20 22 its program.  In any case, a test must be conducted 30 days
 20 23 prior to harvest.
 20 24    ADMINISTRATION == COUNCIL, DEPARTMENT, AND REGISTRANTS.
 20 25  An industrial hemp council is created comprised of private
 20 26 and public members, including employees of the department,
 20 27 the department of natural resources, the department of public
 20 28 safety, and a regents institution registrant (or Iowa state
 20 29 university of science and technology until a university is
 20 30 registered).  The council also includes four legislative
 20 31 members.  The council is to advise the department and the
 20 32 registrant regarding the administration and enforcement of the
 20 33 bill, including the two programs, the issuance of licenses,
 20 34 and the selection of program participants, the importation
 20 35 and certification of seed, the generation of revenue from the
 21  1 sale of seed and fees, and enforcement actions taken against
 21  2 licensees.  The council is also responsible for preparing
 21  3 an annual report regarding the success of the programs for
 21  4 submission to the governor and general assembly.
 21  5    ADMINISTRATION == PROGRAMS.  Under the industrial hemp
 21  6 commodity program, industrial hemp must be produced by a person
 21  7 licensed by the department, and under the industrial hemp
 21  8 production program, industrial hemp must be produced either by
 21  9 the registrant or by a licensee selected by the registrant.
 21 10 The bill also provides for requirements for the selection of
 21 11 licensees to participate in a program, including the processing
 21 12 of applications for licenses, the terms and conditions of
 21 13 a contract to participate in an industrial hemp production
 21 14 program, the inspection of a licensee's records, the inspection
 21 15 of a licensee's facilities, and testing of the licensee's crop.
 21 16    ADMINISTRATION == CERTIFICATION AND SALE OF SEED.  The
 21 17 department is responsible for certifying industrial hemp seed
 21 18 capable of germination.  Either the department or a registrant
 21 19 may obtain authorization by DEA to import seed for departmental
 21 20 certification and either administrative entity may sell the
 21 21 seed to the other entity or a licensee participating in one of
 21 22 the programs.
 21 23    FINANCE == MONEYS COLLECTED AND EXPENDED BY THE
 21 24 ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITIES.  Moneys collected from the sale of
 21 25 seed are retained by either the department or the registrant
 21 26 acting as the seller and must be used to administer their
 21 27 respective programs.   Each administrative entity may also
 21 28 collect fees associated with administering their program and
 21 29 regulating licensees.  These fees include an application
 21 30 fee, licensee fee, inspection fee, and laboratory fee.  The
 21 31 amount of the fee must be based on an estimate of expenses
 21 32 necessary to administer the administrative entity's program.
 21 33 Moneys collected by the department from certified seed sales
 21 34 and fees must be deposited into an industrial hemp commodity
 21 35 fund which are appropriated to the department to administer
 22  1 its program.  Moneys paid to a registrant are retained by the
 22  2 registrant and treated as repayment receipts for costs incurred
 22  3 in administering its program.
 22  4    ENFORCEMENT == COOPERATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC
 22  5 SAFETY.  The department and a registrant must cooperate with
 22  6 the department of public safety in administering and enforcing
 22  7 the provisions of the bill.
 22  8    ENFORCEMENT == CONFISCATION.  If a licensee produces
 22  9 a plant exceeding the maximum allowed concentration of
 22 10 delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol, the plant must be confiscated
 22 11 and destroyed by the department or registrant supervising
 22 12 production and with assistance by the department of public
 22 13 safety or a local law enforcement authority.
 22 14    ENFORCEMENT == DISCIPLINARY ACTION.  The department may
 22 15 suspend or revoke a person's license for providing false
 22 16 or misleading information on an application prior to being
 22 17 selected or to the department or a registrant after being
 22 18 selected.  The department may also suspend or revoke a license

 21 25 seed are retained by either the department or the registrant
 21 26 acting as the seller and must be used to administer their
 21 27 respective programs.   Each administrative entity may also
 21 28 collect fees associated with administering their program and
 21 29 regulating licensees.  These fees include an application
 21 30 fee, licensee fee, inspection fee, and laboratory fee.  The
 21 31 amount of the fee must be based on an estimate of expenses
 21 32 necessary to administer the administrative entity's program.
 21 33 Moneys collected by the department from certified seed sales
 21 34 and fees must be deposited into an industrial hemp commodity
 21 35 fund which are appropriated to the department to administer

 19 19 2014 (7 U.S.C. {5940), which legalizes the possession and
 19 20 use of industrial hemp if regulated by a state department of
 19 21 agriculture administering a pilot program.  The federal law
 19 22 also authorizes an institution of higher education (registrant)
 19 23 to produce industrial hemp in order to advance academic
 19 24 research.  The federal law does not authorize a federal agency
 19 25 to implement or oversee the program.  However, it also does
 19 26 not expressly supersede other federal laws that restrict items
 19 27 designated as controlled substances including the federal
 19 28 "Controlled Substances Import and Export Act" (21 U.S.C. {951
 19 29 et seq.), requiring that cannabis seeds capable of germination

 20 15 the maximum concentration of delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol
 20 16 present in the plant cannot exceed three=tenths of 1 percent
 20 17 as analyzed on a dry weight basis.  During production (from
 20 18 planting to harvest), a crop must be tested by a qualified
 20 19 public or private laboratory approved by the department.  A
 20 20 licensee must test the crop as required by the department or
 20 21 registrant.  The department or registrant may test a crop under
 20 22 its program.  In any case, a test must be conducted 30 days

 21 22 the programs.
 21 23    FINANCE == MONEYS COLLECTED AND EXPENDED BY THE
 21 24 ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITIES.  Moneys collected from the sale of
 21 25 seed are retained by either the department or the registrant
 21 26 acting as the seller and must be used to administer their
 21 27 respective programs.   Each administrative entity may also
 21 28 collect fees associated with administering their program and
 21 29 regulating licensees.  These fees include an application
 21 30 fee, licensee fee, inspection fee, and laboratory fee.  The
 21 31 amount of the fee must be based on an estimate of expenses
 21 32 necessary to administer the administrative entity's program.
 21 33 Moneys collected by the department from certified seed sales
 21 34 and fees must be deposited into an industrial hemp commodity
 21 35 fund which are appropriated to the department to administer
 22  1 its program.  Moneys paid to a registrant are retained by the

 22 20 in statute, a rule adopted by the department, or an industrial
 22 21 hemp production contract.
 22 22    ENFORCEMENT == CIVIL PENALTIES.  A person who violates a
 22 23 provision of the bill is subject to a civil penalty of not less
 22 24 than $500 and not more than $2,500 as assessed and collected by
 22 25 the department.  Each day that a continuing violation occurs
 22 26 is considered a separate offense.  The department is required
 22 27 to establish a schedule of civil penalties for violations.
 22 28 A civil penalty cannot be imposed against a licensee for a
 22 29 violation that results in the confiscation and destruction of
 22 30 the licensee's crop unless the composite test result for the
 22 31 crop is a concentration greater than 2 percent.
 22 32    ENFORCEMENT == CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A person who knowingly
 22 33 or intentionally produces the plant and who is not the
 22 34 department, a registrant, or a licensee participating in a

 20 21 registrant.  The department or registrant may test a crop under
 20 22 its program.  In any case, a test must be conducted 30 days
 20 23 prior to harvest.
 20 24    ADMINISTRATION == COUNCIL, DEPARTMENT, AND REGISTRANTS.
 20 25  An industrial hemp council is created comprised of private
 20 26 and public members, including employees of the department,
 20 27 the department of natural resources, the department of public
 20 28 safety, and a regents institution registrant (or Iowa state
 20 29 university of science and technology until a university is
 20 30 registered).  The council also includes four legislative
 20 31 members.  The council is to advise the department and the
 20 32 registrant regarding the administration and enforcement of the
 20 33 bill, including the two programs, the issuance of licenses,
 20 34 and the selection of program participants, the importation
 20 35 and certification of seed, the generation of revenue from the
 21  1 sale of seed and fees, and enforcement actions taken against
 21  2 licensees.  The council is also responsible for preparing
 21  3 an annual report regarding the success of the programs for
 21  4 submission to the governor and general assembly.
 21  5    ADMINISTRATION == PROGRAMS.  Under the industrial hemp
 21  6 commodity program, industrial hemp must be produced by a person
 21  7 licensed by the department, and under the industrial hemp
 21  8 production program, industrial hemp must be produced either by
 21  9 the registrant or by a licensee selected by the registrant.
 21 10 The bill also provides for requirements for the selection of
 21 11 licensees to participate in a program, including the processing
 21 12 of applications for licenses, the terms and conditions of
 21 13 a contract to participate in an industrial hemp production
 21 14 program, the inspection of a licensee's records, the inspection
 21 15 of a licensee's facilities, and testing of the licensee's crop.
 21 16    ADMINISTRATION == CERTIFICATION AND SALE OF SEED.  The
 21 17 department is responsible for certifying industrial hemp seed
 21 18 capable of germination.  Either the department or a registrant
 21 19 may obtain authorization by DEA to import seed for departmental
 21 20 certification and either administrative entity may sell the
 21 21 seed to the other entity or a licensee participating in one of
 21 22 the programs.
 21 23    FINANCE == MONEYS COLLECTED AND EXPENDED BY THE
 21 24 ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITIES.  Moneys collected from the sale of
 21 25 seed are retained by either the department or the registrant
 21 26 acting as the seller and must be used to administer their
 21 27 respective programs.   Each administrative entity may also
 21 28 collect fees associated with administering their program and
 21 29 regulating licensees.  These fees include an application
 21 30 fee, licensee fee, inspection fee, and laboratory fee.  The
 21 31 amount of the fee must be based on an estimate of expenses
 21 32 necessary to administer the administrative entity's program.
 21 33 Moneys collected by the department from certified seed sales
 21 34 and fees must be deposited into an industrial hemp commodity
 21 35 fund which are appropriated to the department to administer
 22  1 its program.  Moneys paid to a registrant are retained by the
 22  2 registrant and treated as repayment receipts for costs incurred
 22  3 in administering its program.
 22  4    ENFORCEMENT == COOPERATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC
 22  5 SAFETY.  The department and a registrant must cooperate with
 22  6 the department of public safety in administering and enforcing
 22  7 the provisions of the bill.
 22  8    ENFORCEMENT == CONFISCATION.  If a licensee produces
 22  9 a plant exceeding the maximum allowed concentration of
 22 10 delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol, the plant must be confiscated
 22 11 and destroyed by the department or registrant supervising
 22 12 production and with assistance by the department of public
 22 13 safety or a local law enforcement authority.
 22 14    ENFORCEMENT == DISCIPLINARY ACTION.  The department may
 22 15 suspend or revoke a person's license for providing false
 22 16 or misleading information on an application prior to being
 22 17 selected or to the department or a registrant after being
 22 18 selected.  The department may also suspend or revoke a license
 22 19 for failing to comply with a program requirement as set forth
 22 20 in statute, a rule adopted by the department, or an industrial
 22 21 hemp production contract.
 22 22    ENFORCEMENT == CIVIL PENALTIES.  A person who violates a
 22 23 provision of the bill is subject to a civil penalty of not less
 22 24 than $500 and not more than $2,500 as assessed and collected by
 22 25 the department.  Each day that a continuing violation occurs
 22 26 is considered a separate offense.  The department is required
 22 27 to establish a schedule of civil penalties for violations.
 22 28 A civil penalty cannot be imposed against a licensee for a
 22 29 violation that results in the confiscation and destruction of
 22 30 the licensee's crop unless the composite test result for the
 22 31 crop is a concentration greater than 2 percent.
 22 32    ENFORCEMENT == CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A person who knowingly
 22 33 or intentionally produces the plant and who is not the
 22 34 department, a registrant, or a licensee participating in a
 22 35 program is subject to the criminal penalties described in Code
 23  1 chapters 124 and 453B.  A person who knowingly or intentionally
 23  2 possesses marijuana as a first offense is punishable by
 23  3 imprisonment in the county jail for not more than six months or
 23  4 by a fine of not more than $1,000 (Code section 124.401).  For a
 23  5 second offense, the person is guilty of a serious misdemeanor,
 23  6 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 23  7 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.  For a third or
 23  8 subsequent offense, the person is guilty of a class "D" felony,
 23  9 punishable by confinement for no more than five years and a
 23 10 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500. A person acting
 23 11 in violation of Code chapter 453B for failing to pay an excise
 23 12 tax on the sale of marijuana (Code section 453B.7) is also
 23 13 guilty of a class "D" felony (Code section 453B.12).

 19 16    FEDERAL LAW.  The purpose of the programs is to determine
 19 17 the commercial viability of industrial hemp as described in
 19 18 federal legislation, section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of
 19 19 2014 (7 U.S.C. {5940), which legalizes the possession and
 19 20 use of industrial hemp if regulated by a state department of
 19 21 agriculture administering a pilot program.  The federal law
 19 22 also authorizes an institution of higher education (registrant)
 19 23 to produce industrial hemp in order to advance academic
 19 24 research.  The federal law does not authorize a federal agency
 19 25 to implement or oversee the program.  However, it also does
 19 26 not expressly supersede other federal laws that restrict items
 19 27 designated as controlled substances including the federal
 19 28 "Controlled Substances Import and Export Act" (21 U.S.C. {951
 19 29 et seq.), requiring that cannabis seeds capable of germination
 19 30 only be imported into a state by persons registered with the
 19 31 drug enforcement administration of the United States department
 19 32 of justice (DEA).
 19 33    IOWA'S UNIFORM CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT.  A person who
 19 34 produces industrial hemp under one of the two programs is
 19 35 exempted from state criminal law included in the "Uniform
 20  1 Controlled Substances Act" (Code chapter 124) which prohibits
 20  2 persons from knowingly or intentionally possessing a controlled
 20  3 substance (Code section 124.401) including the plant referred
 20  4 to as marijuana included as a schedule I controlled substance
 20  5 (Code section 124.204).  "Marijuana" includes all parts of
 20  6 the plant without regard to THC concentration (Code section
 20  7 124.101).
 20  8    GENERAL == PARTICIPATION IN A PROGRAM REQUIRED.  A person
 20  9 is prohibited from producing, handling, transporting,
 20 10 marketing, or processing industrial hemp in this state unless
 20 11 the industrial hemp has been produced under one of the two
 20 12 programs.  There is no prohibition for marketing an industrial
 20 13 hemp product.
 20 14    GENERAL == TESTING.  In order to qualify as industrial hemp,
 20 15 the maximum concentration of delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol
 20 16 present in the plant cannot exceed three=tenths of 1 percent
 20 17 as analyzed on a dry weight basis.  During production (from
 20 18 planting to harvest), a crop must be tested by a qualified
 20 19 public or private laboratory approved by the department.  A
 20 20 licensee must test the crop as required by the department or
 20 21 registrant.  The department or registrant may test a crop under
 20 22 its program.  In any case, a test must be conducted 30 days

 20 18 planting to harvest), a crop must be tested by a qualified
 20 19 public or private laboratory approved by the department.  A
 20 20 licensee must test the crop as required by the department or
 20 21 registrant.  The department or registrant may test a crop under
 20 22 its program.  In any case, a test must be conducted 30 days
 20 23 prior to harvest.
 20 24    ADMINISTRATION == COUNCIL, DEPARTMENT, AND REGISTRANTS.
 20 25  An industrial hemp council is created comprised of private
 20 26 and public members, including employees of the department,
 20 27 the department of natural resources, the department of public
 20 28 safety, and a regents institution registrant (or Iowa state
 20 29 university of science and technology until a university is
 20 30 registered).  The council also includes four legislative
 20 31 members.  The council is to advise the department and the
 20 32 registrant regarding the administration and enforcement of the
 20 33 bill, including the two programs, the issuance of licenses,
 20 34 and the selection of program participants, the importation
 20 35 and certification of seed, the generation of revenue from the
 21  1 sale of seed and fees, and enforcement actions taken against
 21  2 licensees.  The council is also responsible for preparing
 21  3 an annual report regarding the success of the programs for
 21  4 submission to the governor and general assembly.
 21  5    ADMINISTRATION == PROGRAMS.  Under the industrial hemp
 21  6 commodity program, industrial hemp must be produced by a person
 21  7 licensed by the department, and under the industrial hemp
 21  8 production program, industrial hemp must be produced either by
 21  9 the registrant or by a licensee selected by the registrant.
 21 10 The bill also provides for requirements for the selection of
 21 11 licensees to participate in a program, including the processing
 21 12 of applications for licenses, the terms and conditions of
 21 13 a contract to participate in an industrial hemp production
 21 14 program, the inspection of a licensee's records, the inspection
 21 15 of a licensee's facilities, and testing of the licensee's crop.
 21 16    ADMINISTRATION == CERTIFICATION AND SALE OF SEED.  The
 21 17 department is responsible for certifying industrial hemp seed
 21 18 capable of germination.  Either the department or a registrant
 21 19 may obtain authorization by DEA to import seed for departmental
 21 20 certification and either administrative entity may sell the
 21 21 seed to the other entity or a licensee participating in one of
 21 22 the programs.
 21 23    FINANCE == MONEYS COLLECTED AND EXPENDED BY THE
 21 24 ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITIES.  Moneys collected from the sale of
 21 25 seed are retained by either the department or the registrant
 21 26 acting as the seller and must be used to administer their
 21 27 respective programs.   Each administrative entity may also
 21 28 collect fees associated with administering their program and
 21 29 regulating licensees.  These fees include an application
 21 30 fee, licensee fee, inspection fee, and laboratory fee.  The
 21 31 amount of the fee must be based on an estimate of expenses
 21 32 necessary to administer the administrative entity's program.
 21 33 Moneys collected by the department from certified seed sales
 21 34 and fees must be deposited into an industrial hemp commodity
 21 35 fund which are appropriated to the department to administer
 22  1 its program.  Moneys paid to a registrant are retained by the
 22  2 registrant and treated as repayment receipts for costs incurred
 22  3 in administering its program.
 22  4    ENFORCEMENT == COOPERATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC
 22  5 SAFETY.  The department and a registrant must cooperate with
 22  6 the department of public safety in administering and enforcing
 22  7 the provisions of the bill.
 22  8    ENFORCEMENT == CONFISCATION.  If a licensee produces
 22  9 a plant exceeding the maximum allowed concentration of
 22 10 delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol, the plant must be confiscated
 22 11 and destroyed by the department or registrant supervising
 22 12 production and with assistance by the department of public
 22 13 safety or a local law enforcement authority.
 22 14    ENFORCEMENT == DISCIPLINARY ACTION.  The department may
 22 15 suspend or revoke a person's license for providing false
 22 16 or misleading information on an application prior to being
 22 17 selected or to the department or a registrant after being
 22 18 selected.  The department may also suspend or revoke a license
 22 19 for failing to comply with a program requirement as set forth
 22 20 in statute, a rule adopted by the department, or an industrial
 22 21 hemp production contract.
 22 22    ENFORCEMENT == CIVIL PENALTIES.  A person who violates a
 22 23 provision of the bill is subject to a civil penalty of not less
 22 24 than $500 and not more than $2,500 as assessed and collected by
 22 25 the department.  Each day that a continuing violation occurs
 22 26 is considered a separate offense.  The department is required
 22 27 to establish a schedule of civil penalties for violations.
 22 28 A civil penalty cannot be imposed against a licensee for a
 22 29 violation that results in the confiscation and destruction of
 22 30 the licensee's crop unless the composite test result for the
 22 31 crop is a concentration greater than 2 percent.
 22 32    ENFORCEMENT == CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A person who knowingly
 22 33 or intentionally produces the plant and who is not the
 22 34 department, a registrant, or a licensee participating in a
 22 35 program is subject to the criminal penalties described in Code
 23  1 chapters 124 and 453B.  A person who knowingly or intentionally
 23  2 possesses marijuana as a first offense is punishable by
 23  3 imprisonment in the county jail for not more than six months or
 23  4 by a fine of not more than $1,000 (Code section 124.401).  For a
 23  5 second offense, the person is guilty of a serious misdemeanor,
 23  6 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 23  7 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.  For a third or

 20 26 and public members, including employees of the department,
 20 27 the department of natural resources, the department of public
 20 28 safety, and a regents institution registrant (or Iowa state
 20 29 university of science and technology until a university is
 20 30 registered).  The council also includes four legislative
 20 31 members.  The council is to advise the department and the
 20 32 registrant regarding the administration and enforcement of the
 20 33 bill, including the two programs, the issuance of licenses,
 20 34 and the selection of program participants, the importation
 20 35 and certification of seed, the generation of revenue from the
 21  1 sale of seed and fees, and enforcement actions taken against
 21  2 licensees.  The council is also responsible for preparing
 21  3 an annual report regarding the success of the programs for
 21  4 submission to the governor and general assembly.
 21  5    ADMINISTRATION == PROGRAMS.  Under the industrial hemp
 21  6 commodity program, industrial hemp must be produced by a person
 21  7 licensed by the department, and under the industrial hemp
 21  8 production program, industrial hemp must be produced either by
 21  9 the registrant or by a licensee selected by the registrant.
 21 10 The bill also provides for requirements for the selection of
 21 11 licensees to participate in a program, including the processing
 21 12 of applications for licenses, the terms and conditions of
 21 13 a contract to participate in an industrial hemp production
 21 14 program, the inspection of a licensee's records, the inspection
 21 15 of a licensee's facilities, and testing of the licensee's crop.
 21 16    ADMINISTRATION == CERTIFICATION AND SALE OF SEED.  The
 21 17 department is responsible for certifying industrial hemp seed
 21 18 capable of germination.  Either the department or a registrant
 21 19 may obtain authorization by DEA to import seed for departmental
 21 20 certification and either administrative entity may sell the
 21 21 seed to the other entity or a licensee participating in one of
 21 22 the programs.
 21 23    FINANCE == MONEYS COLLECTED AND EXPENDED BY THE
 21 24 ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITIES.  Moneys collected from the sale of
 21 25 seed are retained by either the department or the registrant
 21 26 acting as the seller and must be used to administer their
 21 27 respective programs.   Each administrative entity may also
 21 28 collect fees associated with administering their program and
 21 29 regulating licensees.  These fees include an application
 21 30 fee, licensee fee, inspection fee, and laboratory fee.  The
 21 31 amount of the fee must be based on an estimate of expenses
 21 32 necessary to administer the administrative entity's program.
 21 33 Moneys collected by the department from certified seed sales
 21 34 and fees must be deposited into an industrial hemp commodity
 21 35 fund which are appropriated to the department to administer
 22  1 its program.  Moneys paid to a registrant are retained by the
 22  2 registrant and treated as repayment receipts for costs incurred
 22  3 in administering its program.
 22  4    ENFORCEMENT == COOPERATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC
 22  5 SAFETY.  The department and a registrant must cooperate with
 22  6 the department of public safety in administering and enforcing
 22  7 the provisions of the bill.
 22  8    ENFORCEMENT == CONFISCATION.  If a licensee produces
 22  9 a plant exceeding the maximum allowed concentration of
 22 10 delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol, the plant must be confiscated
 22 11 and destroyed by the department or registrant supervising
 22 12 production and with assistance by the department of public
 22 13 safety or a local law enforcement authority.
 22 14    ENFORCEMENT == DISCIPLINARY ACTION.  The department may
 22 15 suspend or revoke a person's license for providing false
 22 16 or misleading information on an application prior to being
 22 17 selected or to the department or a registrant after being
 22 18 selected.  The department may also suspend or revoke a license
 22 19 for failing to comply with a program requirement as set forth
 22 20 in statute, a rule adopted by the department, or an industrial
 22 21 hemp production contract.
 22 22    ENFORCEMENT == CIVIL PENALTIES.  A person who violates a
 22 23 provision of the bill is subject to a civil penalty of not less
 22 24 than $500 and not more than $2,500 as assessed and collected by
 22 25 the department.  Each day that a continuing violation occurs
 22 26 is considered a separate offense.  The department is required
 22 27 to establish a schedule of civil penalties for violations.
 22 28 A civil penalty cannot be imposed against a licensee for a
 22 29 violation that results in the confiscation and destruction of
 22 30 the licensee's crop unless the composite test result for the
 22 31 crop is a concentration greater than 2 percent.
 22 32    ENFORCEMENT == CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A person who knowingly
 22 33 or intentionally produces the plant and who is not the
 22 34 department, a registrant, or a licensee participating in a
 22 35 program is subject to the criminal penalties described in Code
 23  1 chapters 124 and 453B.  A person who knowingly or intentionally
 23  2 possesses marijuana as a first offense is punishable by
 23  3 imprisonment in the county jail for not more than six months or
 23  4 by a fine of not more than $1,000 (Code section 124.401).  For a
 23  5 second offense, the person is guilty of a serious misdemeanor,
 23  6 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 23  7 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.  For a third or

 21 25 seed are retained by either the department or the registrant
 21 26 acting as the seller and must be used to administer their
 21 27 respective programs.   Each administrative entity may also
 21 28 collect fees associated with administering their program and
 21 29 regulating licensees.  These fees include an application
 21 30 fee, licensee fee, inspection fee, and laboratory fee.  The
 21 31 amount of the fee must be based on an estimate of expenses
 21 32 necessary to administer the administrative entity's program.
 21 33 Moneys collected by the department from certified seed sales
 21 34 and fees must be deposited into an industrial hemp commodity
 21 35 fund which are appropriated to the department to administer
 22  1 its program.  Moneys paid to a registrant are retained by the

 20 13 hemp product.
 20 14    GENERAL == TESTING.  In order to qualify as industrial hemp,
 20 15 the maximum concentration of delta=9 tetrahydrocannabinol
 20 16 present in the plant cannot exceed three=tenths of 1 percent
 20 17 as analyzed on a dry weight basis.  During production (from
 20 18 planting to harvest), a crop must be tested by a qualified
 20 19 public or private laboratory approved by the department.  A
 20 20 licensee must test the crop as required by the department or
 20 21 registrant.  The department or registrant may test a crop under
 20 22 its program.  In any case, a test must be conducted 30 days
 20 23 prior to harvest.

 21 22 the programs.
 21 23    FINANCE == MONEYS COLLECTED AND EXPENDED BY THE
 21 24 ADMINISTRATIVE ENTITIES.  Moneys collected from the sale of
 21 25 seed are retained by either the department or the registrant
 21 26 acting as the seller and must be used to administer their
 21 27 respective programs.   Each administrative entity may also
 21 28 collect fees associated with administering their program and
 21 29 regulating licensees.  These fees include an application
 21 30 fee, licensee fee, inspection fee, and laboratory fee.  The
 21 31 amount of the fee must be based on an estimate of expenses
 21 32 necessary to administer the administrative entity's program.
 21 33 Moneys collected by the department from certified seed sales
 21 34 and fees must be deposited into an industrial hemp commodity
 21 35 fund which are appropriated to the department to administer
 22  1 its program.  Moneys paid to a registrant are retained by the
