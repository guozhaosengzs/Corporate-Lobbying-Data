EXPLANATION

The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
10


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
11


GENERAL.
This
bill
amends
provisions
in
Code
chapter
490
12


(“Iowa
Business
Corporation
Act”),
that
became
effective
on
13


March
23,
2011,
and
created
a
special
requirement
governing
the
14


terms
of
office
for
a
public
corporation’s
board
of
directors
15


(board)
elected
by
its
holders
of
common
shares,
unless
the
16


board
elected
to
opt
out
of
the
requirement
by
a
date
certain.
17


See
2011
Iowa
Acts,
chapter
2,
and
Code
section
490.806A,
which
18


in
part
superseded
Code
sections
490.805
and
490.806.
19


STAGGERED
TERMS
FOR
DIRECTORS.
The
2011
Act
required
the
20


public
corporation
to
divide
its
directors
into
three
equal
21


groups
(referred
to
as
“classes”).
The
directors
are
then
22


required
to
serve
staggered
three-year
terms
as
designated
by
23


the
board
with
no
other
corporate
action
required
except
that
24


the
board
was
required
to
amend
its
articles
of
incorporation
25


(articles)
in
order
to
comply
with
the
special
requirement.
26


The
bill
provides
that
beginning
January
1,
2019,
a
director
27


that
was
subject
to
the
special
requirement
due
to
the
2011
28


Act
and
whose
three-year
term
is
to
expire
at
the
next
annual
29


shareholder
meeting
is
to
be
elected
in
the
same
manner
as
30


the
director
of
any
other
corporation.
This
means
that
the
31


shareholders
of
the
public
corporation
will
elect
all
directors
32


whose
terms
are
expiring
for
one-year
terms,
unless
the
33


corporation
has
adopted
the
ordinary
staggered
term
method
34


under
Code
section
490.806.

REPEAL.
On
January
1,
2022,
the
bill
eliminates
a
majority
1


of
the
provisions
that
allowed
for
the
special
requirement
and
2


effectively
restores
the
provisions
in
Code
chapter
490
as
they
3


existed
prior
to
the
2011
Act.
The
one
provision
that
will
4


survive
defines
a
public
corporation.
The
provision
prior
to
5


the
2011
Act
referenced
the
national
association
of
securities
6


dealers
(NASD)
which
is
no
longer
in
existence.
The
bill
7


provides
that
the
articles
of
incorporation
survive
the
repeals
8


of
the
relevant
Code
sections.
