that

(ensuring
that
all
such

The
amount
of
the

is

for
a
pesticide
dealer’s
license
or
the
June

date
when

is
due
(Code
section

The
bill
eliminates
9


an
option
that
allowed
a
dealer
having
less
than
$100,000
in
10


gross
retail
pesticide
sales
(sales)
in

pay
an
amount
equal
to
one-tenth
of

percent
of
the
dealer’s

The

according

existing
statutory
schedule
14


which
assigns
a
specific

The

fee
of
$10
for
16


persons
having
annual
gross
retail
pesticide
sales
of
less
17


than

less
than
19


$25,000.
The
highest
scheduled
fee
is
$100
for
persons
having
20


annual
gross
retail
pesticide
sales
of
less
than
$100,000.
A
21


dealer
having
$100,000
or
more
in
gross
sales
must
continue
to
22


use
the
one-tenth

percent
formula
to
calculate
the
amount
23


of
the

fee.

The

retains
a
three-month
grace
period
granted
to
both
25


types
of

so
long
as
they
pay
a
late
fee.
For
a
dealer
26


having
less
than
$100,000
in
sales,
the
bill
requires
a
flat
27


fee
of
$25
instead
of
the
current
sliding

fee
equaling
28


$10
in
October,

November,
and
$25
after
November.
For
a
29


dealer
having
$100,000
or
more
in
sales,
the
bill
requires
a
30


flat
fee
of
5

fee
instead
