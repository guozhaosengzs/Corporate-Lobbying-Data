  1 17 or implementing, any other national or multistate consortium
  1 18 standards from any source requiring the use of any assessments

  1 21 subsection 21, paragraph "b", subparagraph (1), the state board
  1 22 and the department shall do all of the following:
  1 23    a.  Respect and support the ultimate right of a parent to

  1 27 financial impact on, the child, parent, or school, and with
  1 28 no interference from this state.  This paragraph shall not be
  1 29 construed to prohibit this state from funding public education
  1 30 on a per=pupil basis as provided in chapter 257.
  1 31    b.  (1)  By January 1, 2018, for the school year beginning

  2  2 the academic year beginning July 1, 2008, except that any
  2  3 reference in those standards to the state of Massachusetts
  2  4 shall be changed to Iowa and any state history or government
  2  5 content standards shall be changed to reflect the history
  2  6 and government of Iowa.  The department shall distribute the

  2 26 any manner, including but not limited to English language arts,
  2 27 mathematics, science, social studies, history, or sexuality
  2 28 standards or next generation science standards.
  2 29    (2)  Joining any consortium or any other organization if

  4 12 considering the academic content standards adopted and
  4 13 implemented under this section, shall do all of the following:
  4 14    a.  Establish a fundamental academic curriculum for students
  4 15 enrolled in the school district in kindergarten through grade
  4 16 twelve that defines academic objectives to be achieved by all
  4 17 students and is based upon the school district's educational
  4 18 mission, long=range student goals and student performance
  4 19 objectives, and graduation requirements under section 256.7,
  4 20 subsection 26. The fundamental academic curriculum may vary
  4 21 from the state academic content standards adopted pursuant to
  4 22 this section.
  4 23    b.  After consulting with the school district's teachers and
  4 24 administrators, determine the aligned instructional program

  4 28    c.  Provide adequate time and transparency for public review
  4 29 and comment on the aligned instructional programs by all
  4 30 interested members of the community before final adoption of

  5  9 that adopts academic content standards differing from those
  5 10 adopted and implemented under this section.

 10  1 of immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 10  2                           EXPLANATION
 10  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  5    This bill provides for the termination and elimination of
 10  6 all plans, programs, activities, efforts, and expenditures
 10  7 relating to implementation of the educational initiative
 10  8 commonly referred to as the common core standards, or any
 10  9 derivative or permutation of that educational initiative
 10 10 including but not limited to the Iowa common core standards
 10 11 that have been enacted, adopted, or implemented by the general
 10 12 assembly, the state board of education, or the department
 10 13 of education, including but not limited to any assessments,
 10 14 data collection, and instructions based on or involving that
 10 15 educational initiative.
 10 16    DIVISION I == COMMON CORE STANDARDS PROHIBITED.  The bill
 10 17 establishes new Code section 256.25.  The new Code section
 10 18 prohibits the state board from adopting, aligning to, or
 10 19 implementing any other national or multistate consortium
 10 20 standards from any source requiring the use of any assessments
 10 21 aligned with any other national or multistate consortium
 10 22 standards from any source and requires the state board and
 10 23 the department to respect and support the ultimate right of a
 10 24 parent to opt the parent's child out of public school, and out
 10 25 of any public school activity, practice, or testing that the
 10 26 parent finds unacceptable, with no negative repercussions to,
 10 27 or financial impact on, the child, parent, or school, and with
 10 28 no interference from the state.
 10 29    Also, by January 1, 2018, for the school year beginning
 10 30 July 1, 2018, and each succeeding school year, the state board
 10 31 and the department must adopt and implement state academic
 10 32 content standards for kindergarten through grade twelve
 10 33 (K=12) in English language arts, mathematics, science, and
 10 34 social studies that are the same as the academic standards in
 10 35 effect for the state of Massachusetts during the academic year
 11  1 beginning July 1, 2008, except that any reference in those
 11  2 standards to the state of Massachusetts shall be changed to
 11  3 Iowa and any state history or government content standards
 11  4 shall be changed to reflect the history and government of
 11  5 Iowa.  The department shall distribute the standards to school
 11  6 districts and shall post the standards on the department's
 11  7 internet site within 10 days following adoption of the state
 11  8 academic content standards.  At the same time, the state
 11  9 board and the department must also adopt validated state
 11 10 assessments of student achievement based on the assessment used
 11 11 in Massachusetts during the 2008=2009 school year and aligned
 11 12 to the academic standards in effect in Massachusetts during the
 11 13 2008=2009 school year.
 11 14    The bill directs the state board, the department, and the
 11 15 director of the department, and any other state public employee
 11 16 or authority to take all steps necessary to terminate areas of
 11 17 federal control of the Iowa educational process; and prohibits
 11 18 these entities from adopting or implementing any national
 11 19 or multistate consortium standard from any source, or the
 11 20 use of any assessments aligned with a national or multistate
 11 21 consortium standard that cedes control of Iowa educational
 11 22 standards in any manner; or from joining any consortium or
 11 23 any other organization if participation in that consortium or
 11 24 organization would cede any measure of control over any aspect
 11 25 of Iowa public education to that consortium or organization.
 11 26 This state shall retain sole control over the development,
 11 27 establishment, and revision of course of study standards for
 11 28 K=12.
 11 29    After not less than five years and at the discretion of
 11 30 the state board, the state board may adopt state academic
 11 31 content standards to replace the standards that were based on
 11 32 Massachusetts' standards.  However, these replacement content
 11 33 standards must be developed independently and not as part of a
 11 34 multistate consortium.  Such content standards shall emphasize
 11 35 coherence, focus, and essential knowledge, have evidence of
 12  1 successful application and results, and may be administered
 12  2 using computer technology.  The department shall not implement
 12  3 the replacement content standards until the state board submits
 12  4 the content standards to the general assembly, the general
 12  5 assembly's standing committees on education hold a joint public
 12  6 hearing on the proposed content standards and provide public
 12  7 notice of the public hearing at least 10 days prior to the
 12  8 public hearing; and the content standards are specifically
 12  9 authorized by a constitutional majority of each house of the
 12 10 general assembly and approved by the governor.
 12 11    Each year, as soon as reasonably possible, the aggregated
 12 12 results shall be available on the department internet site
 12 13 for review by the public.  In collecting student achievement
 12 14 data for posting on the internet site, the department shall
 12 15 not collect data about the values, attitudes, beliefs, and
 12 16 personality traits of a student or the student's family or
 12 17 medical, behavioral, mental, biometric, or psychometric data of
 12 18 a student or of the student's family.
 12 19    Prior to implementing the proposed state assessments, the
 12 20 department must submit them to the general assembly, the
 12 21 standing committees on education must hold a public hearing on
 12 22 the proposed assessments and post notice of the hearing 10 days
 12 23 prior to the hearing, and the general assembly and the governor
 12 24 must specifically authorize the assessments in the same manner
 12 25 as the state academic content standards.
 12 26    School districts must establish a fundamental academic
 12 27 curriculum for students enrolled in the school district in K=12
 12 28 that defines academic objectives to be achieved by all students
 12 29 and is based upon the school district's educational mission,
 12 30 long=range student goals and student performance objectives,
 12 31 and the state's graduation requirements.  The fundamental
 12 32 academic curriculum may vary from the state academic content
 12 33 standards adopted pursuant to this section.
 12 34    After consulting with the school district's teachers
 12 35 and administrators, the district must determine the aligned
 13  1 instructional program for delivering its fundamental academic
 13  2 curriculum and identify the courses and programs in which the
 13  3 fundamental academic curriculum will be taught.
 13  4    School districts must provide adequate time and transparency
 13  5 for public review and comment on the aligned instructional
 13  6 programs by all interested members of the community before
 13  7 final adoption of the fundamental academic curriculum.
 13  8    New Code section 256.25 includes language providing that
 13  9 the new Code section shall not be construed to promote any
 13 10 religious or nonreligious doctrine, promote discrimination
 13 11 for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or
 13 12 nonbeliefs, or promote discrimination for or against religion
 13 13 or nonreligion; and that the new Code section does not require
 13 14 any school district to utilize all or any part of the academic
 13 15 content standards adopted.  The state board and the department
 13 16 shall not impose any financial consequence on a school district
 13 17 that adopts academic content standards differing from those
 13 18 adopted and implemented under the new Code section.
 13 19    DIVISION II == ELIMINATING COMMON CORE REFERENCES
 13 20 == PROVIDING FOR RELATED MATTERS.  The bill eliminates
 13 21 requirements and references to the (Iowa) common core or
 13 22 core curriculum and to core content standards, but continues
 13 23 to direct the state board of education to adopt high school
 13 24 graduation requirements and assessment standards.
 13 25    Provisions directing school districts to cooperate with
 13 26 each eighth grade student on a core curriculum plan to meet
 13 27 core curriculum requirements are amended to replace "core
 13 28 curriculum plan" with "graduation plan" and "core curriculum
 13 29 requirements" with "high school graduation requirements".  The
 13 30 term "core content standards", which was used to describe the
 13 31 assessment standards adopted by the state board, is replaced
 13 32 with the term "assessment standards". The assessment standards
 13 33 will remain applicable to all students in kindergarten through
 13 34 grade 12 in every school district and accredited nonpublic
 13 35 school. Corresponding changes are made throughout the Code,
 14  1 and obsolete language is eliminated.

 10  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  5    This bill provides for the termination and elimination of
 10  6 all plans, programs, activities, efforts, and expenditures
 10  7 relating to implementation of the educational initiative
 10  8 commonly referred to as the common core standards, or any
 10  9 derivative or permutation of that educational initiative
 10 10 including but not limited to the Iowa common core standards
 10 11 that have been enacted, adopted, or implemented by the general
 10 12 assembly, the state board of education, or the department
 10 13 of education, including but not limited to any assessments,
 10 14 data collection, and instructions based on or involving that
 10 15 educational initiative.
 10 16    DIVISION I == COMMON CORE STANDARDS PROHIBITED.  The bill
 10 17 establishes new Code section 256.25.  The new Code section
 10 18 prohibits the state board from adopting, aligning to, or
 10 19 implementing any other national or multistate consortium
 10 20 standards from any source requiring the use of any assessments
 10 21 aligned with any other national or multistate consortium
 10 22 standards from any source and requires the state board and
 10 23 the department to respect and support the ultimate right of a
 10 24 parent to opt the parent's child out of public school, and out
 10 25 of any public school activity, practice, or testing that the
 10 26 parent finds unacceptable, with no negative repercussions to,
 10 27 or financial impact on, the child, parent, or school, and with
 10 28 no interference from the state.
 10 29    Also, by January 1, 2018, for the school year beginning
 10 30 July 1, 2018, and each succeeding school year, the state board
 10 31 and the department must adopt and implement state academic
 10 32 content standards for kindergarten through grade twelve
 10 33 (K=12) in English language arts, mathematics, science, and
 10 34 social studies that are the same as the academic standards in
 10 35 effect for the state of Massachusetts during the academic year
 11  1 beginning July 1, 2008, except that any reference in those
 11  2 standards to the state of Massachusetts shall be changed to
 11  3 Iowa and any state history or government content standards
 11  4 shall be changed to reflect the history and government of
 11  5 Iowa.  The department shall distribute the standards to school
 11  6 districts and shall post the standards on the department's
 11  7 internet site within 10 days following adoption of the state
 11  8 academic content standards.  At the same time, the state
 11  9 board and the department must also adopt validated state
 11 10 assessments of student achievement based on the assessment used
 11 11 in Massachusetts during the 2008=2009 school year and aligned
 11 12 to the academic standards in effect in Massachusetts during the
 11 13 2008=2009 school year.
 11 14    The bill directs the state board, the department, and the
 11 15 director of the department, and any other state public employee
 11 16 or authority to take all steps necessary to terminate areas of
 11 17 federal control of the Iowa educational process; and prohibits
 11 18 these entities from adopting or implementing any national
 11 19 or multistate consortium standard from any source, or the
 11 20 use of any assessments aligned with a national or multistate
 11 21 consortium standard that cedes control of Iowa educational
 11 22 standards in any manner; or from joining any consortium or
 11 23 any other organization if participation in that consortium or
 11 24 organization would cede any measure of control over any aspect
 11 25 of Iowa public education to that consortium or organization.
 11 26 This state shall retain sole control over the development,
 11 27 establishment, and revision of course of study standards for
 11 28 K=12.
 11 29    After not less than five years and at the discretion of
 11 30 the state board, the state board may adopt state academic
 11 31 content standards to replace the standards that were based on
 11 32 Massachusetts' standards.  However, these replacement content
 11 33 standards must be developed independently and not as part of a
 11 34 multistate consortium.  Such content standards shall emphasize
 11 35 coherence, focus, and essential knowledge, have evidence of
 12  1 successful application and results, and may be administered
 12  2 using computer technology.  The department shall not implement
 12  3 the replacement content standards until the state board submits
 12  4 the content standards to the general assembly, the general
 12  5 assembly's standing committees on education hold a joint public
 12  6 hearing on the proposed content standards and provide public
 12  7 notice of the public hearing at least 10 days prior to the
 12  8 public hearing; and the content standards are specifically
 12  9 authorized by a constitutional majority of each house of the
 12 10 general assembly and approved by the governor.
 12 11    Each year, as soon as reasonably possible, the aggregated
 12 12 results shall be available on the department internet site
 12 13 for review by the public.  In collecting student achievement
 12 14 data for posting on the internet site, the department shall
 12 15 not collect data about the values, attitudes, beliefs, and
 12 16 personality traits of a student or the student's family or
 12 17 medical, behavioral, mental, biometric, or psychometric data of
 12 18 a student or of the student's family.

 11 24 organization would cede any measure of control over any aspect
 11 25 of Iowa public education to that consortium or organization.
 11 26 This state shall retain sole control over the development,
 11 27 establishment, and revision of course of study standards for
 11 28 K=12.
 11 29    After not less than five years and at the discretion of
 11 30 the state board, the state board may adopt state academic
 11 31 content standards to replace the standards that were based on
 11 32 Massachusetts' standards.  However, these replacement content
 11 33 standards must be developed independently and not as part of a
 11 34 multistate consortium.  Such content standards shall emphasize
 11 35 coherence, focus, and essential knowledge, have evidence of
 12  1 successful application and results, and may be administered
 12  2 using computer technology.  The department shall not implement
 12  3 the replacement content standards until the state board submits
 12  4 the content standards to the general assembly, the general
 12  5 assembly's standing committees on education hold a joint public
 12  6 hearing on the proposed content standards and provide public
 12  7 notice of the public hearing at least 10 days prior to the
 12  8 public hearing; and the content standards are specifically
 12  9 authorized by a constitutional majority of each house of the
 12 10 general assembly and approved by the governor.
 12 11    Each year, as soon as reasonably possible, the aggregated
 12 12 results shall be available on the department internet site
 12 13 for review by the public.  In collecting student achievement
 12 14 data for posting on the internet site, the department shall
 12 15 not collect data about the values, attitudes, beliefs, and
 12 16 personality traits of a student or the student's family or
 12 17 medical, behavioral, mental, biometric, or psychometric data of
 12 18 a student or of the student's family.
 12 19    Prior to implementing the proposed state assessments, the
 12 20 department must submit them to the general assembly, the
 12 21 standing committees on education must hold a public hearing on
 12 22 the proposed assessments and post notice of the hearing 10 days
 12 23 prior to the hearing, and the general assembly and the governor
 12 24 must specifically authorize the assessments in the same manner
 12 25 as the state academic content standards.
 12 26    School districts must establish a fundamental academic
 12 27 curriculum for students enrolled in the school district in K=12
 12 28 that defines academic objectives to be achieved by all students
 12 29 and is based upon the school district's educational mission,
 12 30 long=range student goals and student performance objectives,
 12 31 and the state's graduation requirements.  The fundamental
 12 32 academic curriculum may vary from the state academic content
 12 33 standards adopted pursuant to this section.
 12 34    After consulting with the school district's teachers
 12 35 and administrators, the district must determine the aligned
 13  1 instructional program for delivering its fundamental academic
 13  2 curriculum and identify the courses and programs in which the
 13  3 fundamental academic curriculum will be taught.
 13  4    School districts must provide adequate time and transparency
 13  5 for public review and comment on the aligned instructional
 13  6 programs by all interested members of the community before
 13  7 final adoption of the fundamental academic curriculum.
 13  8    New Code section 256.25 includes language providing that
 13  9 the new Code section shall not be construed to promote any
 13 10 religious or nonreligious doctrine, promote discrimination
 13 11 for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or
 13 12 nonbeliefs, or promote discrimination for or against religion
 13 13 or nonreligion; and that the new Code section does not require
 13 14 any school district to utilize all or any part of the academic
 13 15 content standards adopted.  The state board and the department
 13 16 shall not impose any financial consequence on a school district
 13 17 that adopts academic content standards differing from those
 13 18 adopted and implemented under the new Code section.

 13 23 to direct the state board of education to adopt high school
 13 24 graduation requirements and assessment standards.
 13 25    Provisions directing school districts to cooperate with
 13 26 each eighth grade student on a core curriculum plan to meet
 13 27 core curriculum requirements are amended to replace "core
 13 28 curriculum plan" with "graduation plan" and "core curriculum
 13 29 requirements" with "high school graduation requirements".  The
 13 30 term "core content standards", which was used to describe the
 13 31 assessment standards adopted by the state board, is replaced
 13 32 with the term "assessment standards". The assessment standards
 13 33 will remain applicable to all students in kindergarten through
 13 34 grade 12 in every school district and accredited nonpublic
 13 35 school. Corresponding changes are made throughout the Code,
 14  1 and obsolete language is eliminated.

 10  3 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  4 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  5    This bill provides for the termination and elimination of
 10  6 all plans, programs, activities, efforts, and expenditures
 10  7 relating to implementation of the educational initiative
 10  8 commonly referred to as the common core standards, or any
 10  9 derivative or permutation of that educational initiative
 10 10 including but not limited to the Iowa common core standards
 10 11 that have been enacted, adopted, or implemented by the general
 10 12 assembly, the state board of education, or the department
 10 13 of education, including but not limited to any assessments,
 10 14 data collection, and instructions based on or involving that
 10 15 educational initiative.
 10 16    DIVISION I == COMMON CORE STANDARDS PROHIBITED.  The bill
 10 17 establishes new Code section 256.25.  The new Code section
 10 18 prohibits the state board from adopting, aligning to, or
 10 19 implementing any other national or multistate consortium
 10 20 standards from any source requiring the use of any assessments
 10 21 aligned with any other national or multistate consortium
 10 22 standards from any source and requires the state board and
 10 23 the department to respect and support the ultimate right of a
 10 24 parent to opt the parent's child out of public school, and out
 10 25 of any public school activity, practice, or testing that the
 10 26 parent finds unacceptable, with no negative repercussions to,
 10 27 or financial impact on, the child, parent, or school, and with
 10 28 no interference from the state.
 10 29    Also, by January 1, 2018, for the school year beginning
 10 30 July 1, 2018, and each succeeding school year, the state board
 10 31 and the department must adopt and implement state academic
 10 32 content standards for kindergarten through grade twelve
 10 33 (K=12) in English language arts, mathematics, science, and
 10 34 social studies that are the same as the academic standards in
 10 35 effect for the state of Massachusetts during the academic year
 11  1 beginning July 1, 2008, except that any reference in those
 11  2 standards to the state of Massachusetts shall be changed to
 11  3 Iowa and any state history or government content standards
 11  4 shall be changed to reflect the history and government of
 11  5 Iowa.  The department shall distribute the standards to school
 11  6 districts and shall post the standards on the department's
 11  7 internet site within 10 days following adoption of the state
 11  8 academic content standards.  At the same time, the state
 11  9 board and the department must also adopt validated state
 11 10 assessments of student achievement based on the assessment used
 11 11 in Massachusetts during the 2008=2009 school year and aligned
 11 12 to the academic standards in effect in Massachusetts during the
 11 13 2008=2009 school year.
 11 14    The bill directs the state board, the department, and the
 11 15 director of the department, and any other state public employee
 11 16 or authority to take all steps necessary to terminate areas of
 11 17 federal control of the Iowa educational process; and prohibits
 11 18 these entities from adopting or implementing any national
 11 19 or multistate consortium standard from any source, or the
 11 20 use of any assessments aligned with a national or multistate
 11 21 consortium standard that cedes control of Iowa educational
 11 22 standards in any manner; or from joining any consortium or
 11 23 any other organization if participation in that consortium or
 11 24 organization would cede any measure of control over any aspect
 11 25 of Iowa public education to that consortium or organization.

 11 10 assessments of student achievement based on the assessment used
 11 11 in Massachusetts during the 2008=2009 school year and aligned
 11 12 to the academic standards in effect in Massachusetts during the
 11 13 2008=2009 school year.
 11 14    The bill directs the state board, the department, and the
 11 15 director of the department, and any other state public employee
 11 16 or authority to take all steps necessary to terminate areas of
 11 17 federal control of the Iowa educational process; and prohibits
 11 18 these entities from adopting or implementing any national
 11 19 or multistate consortium standard from any source, or the
 11 20 use of any assessments aligned with a national or multistate
 11 21 consortium standard that cedes control of Iowa educational
 11 22 standards in any manner; or from joining any consortium or
 11 23 any other organization if participation in that consortium or
 11 24 organization would cede any measure of control over any aspect
 11 25 of Iowa public education to that consortium or organization.
 11 26 This state shall retain sole control over the development,
 11 27 establishment, and revision of course of study standards for
 11 28 K=12.
 11 29    After not less than five years and at the discretion of
 11 30 the state board, the state board may adopt state academic
 11 31 content standards to replace the standards that were based on
 11 32 Massachusetts' standards.  However, these replacement content
 11 33 standards must be developed independently and not as part of a
 11 34 multistate consortium.  Such content standards shall emphasize
 11 35 coherence, focus, and essential knowledge, have evidence of
 12  1 successful application and results, and may be administered
 12  2 using computer technology.  The department shall not implement
 12  3 the replacement content standards until the state board submits
 12  4 the content standards to the general assembly, the general
 12  5 assembly's standing committees on education hold a joint public
 12  6 hearing on the proposed content standards and provide public
 12  7 notice of the public hearing at least 10 days prior to the
 12  8 public hearing; and the content standards are specifically
 12  9 authorized by a constitutional majority of each house of the
 12 10 general assembly and approved by the governor.
 12 11    Each year, as soon as reasonably possible, the aggregated
 12 12 results shall be available on the department internet site
 12 13 for review by the public.  In collecting student achievement
 12 14 data for posting on the internet site, the department shall
 12 15 not collect data about the values, attitudes, beliefs, and
 12 16 personality traits of a student or the student's family or
 12 17 medical, behavioral, mental, biometric, or psychometric data of
 12 18 a student or of the student's family.
 12 19    Prior to implementing the proposed state assessments, the
 12 20 department must submit them to the general assembly, the
 12 21 standing committees on education must hold a public hearing on
 12 22 the proposed assessments and post notice of the hearing 10 days
 12 23 prior to the hearing, and the general assembly and the governor
 12 24 must specifically authorize the assessments in the same manner
 12 25 as the state academic content standards.
 12 26    School districts must establish a fundamental academic
 12 27 curriculum for students enrolled in the school district in K=12
 12 28 that defines academic objectives to be achieved by all students
 12 29 and is based upon the school district's educational mission,
 12 30 long=range student goals and student performance objectives,
 12 31 and the state's graduation requirements.  The fundamental
 12 32 academic curriculum may vary from the state academic content
 12 33 standards adopted pursuant to this section.
 12 34    After consulting with the school district's teachers
 12 35 and administrators, the district must determine the aligned
 13  1 instructional program for delivering its fundamental academic
 13  2 curriculum and identify the courses and programs in which the
 13  3 fundamental academic curriculum will be taught.
 13  4    School districts must provide adequate time and transparency
 13  5 for public review and comment on the aligned instructional
 13  6 programs by all interested members of the community before
 13  7 final adoption of the fundamental academic curriculum.
 13  8    New Code section 256.25 includes language providing that
 13  9 the new Code section shall not be construed to promote any
 13 10 religious or nonreligious doctrine, promote discrimination
 13 11 for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or
 13 12 nonbeliefs, or promote discrimination for or against religion
 13 13 or nonreligion; and that the new Code section does not require
 13 14 any school district to utilize all or any part of the academic
 13 15 content standards adopted.  The state board and the department
 13 16 shall not impose any financial consequence on a school district
 13 17 that adopts academic content standards differing from those
 13 18 adopted and implemented under the new Code section.
 13 19    DIVISION II == ELIMINATING COMMON CORE REFERENCES
 13 20 == PROVIDING FOR RELATED MATTERS.  The bill eliminates
 13 21 requirements and references to the (Iowa) common core or
 13 22 core curriculum and to core content standards, but continues
 13 23 to direct the state board of education to adopt high school
 13 24 graduation requirements and assessment standards.
 13 25    Provisions directing school districts to cooperate with
 13 26 each eighth grade student on a core curriculum plan to meet
 13 27 core curriculum requirements are amended to replace "core
 13 28 curriculum plan" with "graduation plan" and "core curriculum
 13 29 requirements" with "high school graduation requirements".  The
 13 30 term "core content standards", which was used to describe the
 13 31 assessment standards adopted by the state board, is replaced
 13 32 with the term "assessment standards". The assessment standards
 13 33 will remain applicable to all students in kindergarten through
 13 34 grade 12 in every school district and accredited nonpublic
 13 35 school. Corresponding changes are made throughout the Code,
 14  1 and obsolete language is eliminated.

 10  7 relating to implementation of the educational initiative
 10  8 commonly referred to as the common core standards, or any
 10  9 derivative or permutation of that educational initiative
 10 10 including but not limited to the Iowa common core standards
 10 11 that have been enacted, adopted, or implemented by the general
 10 12 assembly, the state board of education, or the department
 10 13 of education, including but not limited to any assessments,
 10 14 data collection, and instructions based on or involving that
 10 15 educational initiative.
 10 16    DIVISION I == COMMON CORE STANDARDS PROHIBITED.  The bill
 10 17 establishes new Code section 256.25.  The new Code section
 10 18 prohibits the state board from adopting, aligning to, or
 10 19 implementing any other national or multistate consortium
 10 20 standards from any source requiring the use of any assessments
 10 21 aligned with any other national or multistate consortium
 10 22 standards from any source and requires the state board and
 10 23 the department to respect and support the ultimate right of a
 10 24 parent to opt the parent's child out of public school, and out
 10 25 of any public school activity, practice, or testing that the
 10 26 parent finds unacceptable, with no negative repercussions to,
 10 27 or financial impact on, the child, parent, or school, and with
 10 28 no interference from the state.
 10 29    Also, by January 1, 2018, for the school year beginning
 10 30 July 1, 2018, and each succeeding school year, the state board
 10 31 and the department must adopt and implement state academic
 10 32 content standards for kindergarten through grade twelve
 10 33 (K=12) in English language arts, mathematics, science, and
 10 34 social studies that are the same as the academic standards in
 10 35 effect for the state of Massachusetts during the academic year
 11  1 beginning July 1, 2008, except that any reference in those
 11  2 standards to the state of Massachusetts shall be changed to
 11  3 Iowa and any state history or government content standards
 11  4 shall be changed to reflect the history and government of
 11  5 Iowa.  The department shall distribute the standards to school
 11  6 districts and shall post the standards on the department's
 11  7 internet site within 10 days following adoption of the state
 11  8 academic content standards.  At the same time, the state

 11 10 assessments of student achievement based on the assessment used
 11 11 in Massachusetts during the 2008=2009 school year and aligned
 11 12 to the academic standards in effect in Massachusetts during the
 11 13 2008=2009 school year.
 11 14    The bill directs the state board, the department, and the
 11 15 director of the department, and any other state public employee
 11 16 or authority to take all steps necessary to terminate areas of
 11 17 federal control of the Iowa educational process; and prohibits
 11 18 these entities from adopting or implementing any national
 11 19 or multistate consortium standard from any source, or the
 11 20 use of any assessments aligned with a national or multistate
 11 21 consortium standard that cedes control of Iowa educational
 11 22 standards in any manner; or from joining any consortium or
 11 23 any other organization if participation in that consortium or
 11 24 organization would cede any measure of control over any aspect
 11 25 of Iowa public education to that consortium or organization.
 11 26 This state shall retain sole control over the development,
 11 27 establishment, and revision of course of study standards for
 11 28 K=12.
 11 29    After not less than five years and at the discretion of
 11 30 the state board, the state board may adopt state academic
 11 31 content standards to replace the standards that were based on
 11 32 Massachusetts' standards.  However, these replacement content
 11 33 standards must be developed independently and not as part of a
 11 34 multistate consortium.  Such content standards shall emphasize
 11 35 coherence, focus, and essential knowledge, have evidence of
 12  1 successful application and results, and may be administered
 12  2 using computer technology.  The department shall not implement
 12  3 the replacement content standards until the state board submits
 12  4 the content standards to the general assembly, the general
 12  5 assembly's standing committees on education hold a joint public
 12  6 hearing on the proposed content standards and provide public
 12  7 notice of the public hearing at least 10 days prior to the
 12  8 public hearing; and the content standards are specifically
 12  9 authorized by a constitutional majority of each house of the
 12 10 general assembly and approved by the governor.
 12 11    Each year, as soon as reasonably possible, the aggregated
 12 12 results shall be available on the department internet site
 12 13 for review by the public.  In collecting student achievement
 12 14 data for posting on the internet site, the department shall
 12 15 not collect data about the values, attitudes, beliefs, and
 12 16 personality traits of a student or the student's family or
 12 17 medical, behavioral, mental, biometric, or psychometric data of
 12 18 a student or of the student's family.
 12 19    Prior to implementing the proposed state assessments, the
 12 20 department must submit them to the general assembly, the
 12 21 standing committees on education must hold a public hearing on
 12 22 the proposed assessments and post notice of the hearing 10 days
 12 23 prior to the hearing, and the general assembly and the governor
 12 24 must specifically authorize the assessments in the same manner
 12 25 as the state academic content standards.
 12 26    School districts must establish a fundamental academic
 12 27 curriculum for students enrolled in the school district in K=12
 12 28 that defines academic objectives to be achieved by all students
 12 29 and is based upon the school district's educational mission,
 12 30 long=range student goals and student performance objectives,
 12 31 and the state's graduation requirements.  The fundamental
 12 32 academic curriculum may vary from the state academic content
 12 33 standards adopted pursuant to this section.
 12 34    After consulting with the school district's teachers
 12 35 and administrators, the district must determine the aligned
 13  1 instructional program for delivering its fundamental academic
 13  2 curriculum and identify the courses and programs in which the
 13  3 fundamental academic curriculum will be taught.
 13  4    School districts must provide adequate time and transparency
 13  5 for public review and comment on the aligned instructional
 13  6 programs by all interested members of the community before
 13  7 final adoption of the fundamental academic curriculum.
 13  8    New Code section 256.25 includes language providing that
 13  9 the new Code section shall not be construed to promote any
 13 10 religious or nonreligious doctrine, promote discrimination
 13 11 for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or
 13 12 nonbeliefs, or promote discrimination for or against religion
 13 13 or nonreligion; and that the new Code section does not require
 13 14 any school district to utilize all or any part of the academic
 13 15 content standards adopted.  The state board and the department
 13 16 shall not impose any financial consequence on a school district
 13 17 that adopts academic content standards differing from those
 13 18 adopted and implemented under the new Code section.
 13 19    DIVISION II == ELIMINATING COMMON CORE REFERENCES
 13 20 == PROVIDING FOR RELATED MATTERS.  The bill eliminates
 13 21 requirements and references to the (Iowa) common core or
 13 22 core curriculum and to core content standards, but continues
 13 23 to direct the state board of education to adopt high school
 13 24 graduation requirements and assessment standards.
 13 25    Provisions directing school districts to cooperate with
 13 26 each eighth grade student on a core curriculum plan to meet
 13 27 core curriculum requirements are amended to replace "core
 13 28 curriculum plan" with "graduation plan" and "core curriculum
 13 29 requirements" with "high school graduation requirements".  The
 13 30 term "core content standards", which was used to describe the
 13 31 assessment standards adopted by the state board, is replaced
 13 32 with the term "assessment standards". The assessment standards
 13 33 will remain applicable to all students in kindergarten through
 13 34 grade 12 in every school district and accredited nonpublic
 13 35 school. Corresponding changes are made throughout the Code,
 14  1 and obsolete language is eliminated.

 10 20 standards from any source requiring the use of any assessments
 10 21 aligned with any other national or multistate consortium

 10 23 the department to respect and support the ultimate right of a
 10 24 parent to opt the parent's child out of public school, and out
 10 25 of any public school activity, practice, or testing that the
 10 26 parent finds unacceptable, with no negative repercussions to,
 10 27 or financial impact on, the child, parent, or school, and with
 10 28 no interference from the state.
 10 29    Also, by January 1, 2018, for the school year beginning
 10 30 July 1, 2018, and each succeeding school year, the state board
 10 31 and the department must adopt and implement state academic
 10 32 content standards for kindergarten through grade twelve
 10 33 (K=12) in English language arts, mathematics, science, and
 10 34 social studies that are the same as the academic standards in
 10 35 effect for the state of Massachusetts during the academic year
 11  1 beginning July 1, 2008, except that any reference in those
 11  2 standards to the state of Massachusetts shall be changed to
 11  3 Iowa and any state history or government content standards
 11  4 shall be changed to reflect the history and government of
 11  5 Iowa.  The department shall distribute the standards to school
 11  6 districts and shall post the standards on the department's

 11 21 consortium standard that cedes control of Iowa educational
 11 22 standards in any manner; or from joining any consortium or
 11 23 any other organization if participation in that consortium or
 11 24 organization would cede any measure of control over any aspect
 11 25 of Iowa public education to that consortium or organization.
 11 26 This state shall retain sole control over the development,
 11 27 establishment, and revision of course of study standards for
 11 28 K=12.
 11 29    After not less than five years and at the discretion of
 11 30 the state board, the state board may adopt state academic
 11 31 content standards to replace the standards that were based on
 11 32 Massachusetts' standards.  However, these replacement content
 11 33 standards must be developed independently and not as part of a
 11 34 multistate consortium.  Such content standards shall emphasize
 11 35 coherence, focus, and essential knowledge, have evidence of
 12  1 successful application and results, and may be administered
 12  2 using computer technology.  The department shall not implement
 12  3 the replacement content standards until the state board submits
 12  4 the content standards to the general assembly, the general
 12  5 assembly's standing committees on education hold a joint public
 12  6 hearing on the proposed content standards and provide public
 12  7 notice of the public hearing at least 10 days prior to the
 12  8 public hearing; and the content standards are specifically
 12  9 authorized by a constitutional majority of each house of the
 12 10 general assembly and approved by the governor.
 12 11    Each year, as soon as reasonably possible, the aggregated
 12 12 results shall be available on the department internet site
 12 13 for review by the public.  In collecting student achievement
 12 14 data for posting on the internet site, the department shall
 12 15 not collect data about the values, attitudes, beliefs, and
 12 16 personality traits of a student or the student's family or
 12 17 medical, behavioral, mental, biometric, or psychometric data of
 12 18 a student or of the student's family.
 12 19    Prior to implementing the proposed state assessments, the
 12 20 department must submit them to the general assembly, the
 12 21 standing committees on education must hold a public hearing on
 12 22 the proposed assessments and post notice of the hearing 10 days
 12 23 prior to the hearing, and the general assembly and the governor
 12 24 must specifically authorize the assessments in the same manner
 12 25 as the state academic content standards.
 12 26    School districts must establish a fundamental academic
 12 27 curriculum for students enrolled in the school district in K=12
 12 28 that defines academic objectives to be achieved by all students
 12 29 and is based upon the school district's educational mission,
 12 30 long=range student goals and student performance objectives,
 12 31 and the state's graduation requirements.  The fundamental
 12 32 academic curriculum may vary from the state academic content
 12 33 standards adopted pursuant to this section.
 12 34    After consulting with the school district's teachers
 12 35 and administrators, the district must determine the aligned
 13  1 instructional program for delivering its fundamental academic
 13  2 curriculum and identify the courses and programs in which the
 13  3 fundamental academic curriculum will be taught.
 13  4    School districts must provide adequate time and transparency
 13  5 for public review and comment on the aligned instructional
 13  6 programs by all interested members of the community before
 13  7 final adoption of the fundamental academic curriculum.
 13  8    New Code section 256.25 includes language providing that
 13  9 the new Code section shall not be construed to promote any
 13 10 religious or nonreligious doctrine, promote discrimination
 13 11 for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or
 13 12 nonbeliefs, or promote discrimination for or against religion
 13 13 or nonreligion; and that the new Code section does not require
 13 14 any school district to utilize all or any part of the academic
 13 15 content standards adopted.  The state board and the department
 13 16 shall not impose any financial consequence on a school district
 13 17 that adopts academic content standards differing from those
 13 18 adopted and implemented under the new Code section.
 13 19    DIVISION II == ELIMINATING COMMON CORE REFERENCES
 13 20 == PROVIDING FOR RELATED MATTERS.  The bill eliminates
 13 21 requirements and references to the (Iowa) common core or
 13 22 core curriculum and to core content standards, but continues
 13 23 to direct the state board of education to adopt high school
 13 24 graduation requirements and assessment standards.
 13 25    Provisions directing school districts to cooperate with
 13 26 each eighth grade student on a core curriculum plan to meet
 13 27 core curriculum requirements are amended to replace "core
 13 28 curriculum plan" with "graduation plan" and "core curriculum
 13 29 requirements" with "high school graduation requirements".  The
 13 30 term "core content standards", which was used to describe the
 13 31 assessment standards adopted by the state board, is replaced
 13 32 with the term "assessment standards". The assessment standards
 13 33 will remain applicable to all students in kindergarten through
 13 34 grade 12 in every school district and accredited nonpublic
 13 35 school. Corresponding changes are made throughout the Code,
 14  1 and obsolete language is eliminated.

 10 30 July 1, 2018, and each succeeding school year, the state board
 10 31 and the department must adopt and implement state academic
 10 32 content standards for kindergarten through grade twelve
 10 33 (K=12) in English language arts, mathematics, science, and
 10 34 social studies that are the same as the academic standards in

 11  8 academic content standards.  At the same time, the state
 11  9 board and the department must also adopt validated state
 11 10 assessments of student achievement based on the assessment used
 11 11 in Massachusetts during the 2008=2009 school year and aligned
 11 12 to the academic standards in effect in Massachusetts during the
 11 13 2008=2009 school year.
 11 14    The bill directs the state board, the department, and the
 11 15 director of the department, and any other state public employee

 12  8 public hearing; and the content standards are specifically
 12  9 authorized by a constitutional majority of each house of the
 12 10 general assembly and approved by the governor.
 12 11    Each year, as soon as reasonably possible, the aggregated
 12 12 results shall be available on the department internet site
 12 13 for review by the public.  In collecting student achievement
 12 14 data for posting on the internet site, the department shall
 12 15 not collect data about the values, attitudes, beliefs, and
 12 16 personality traits of a student or the student's family or
 12 17 medical, behavioral, mental, biometric, or psychometric data of
 12 18 a student or of the student's family.
 12 19    Prior to implementing the proposed state assessments, the
 12 20 department must submit them to the general assembly, the
 12 21 standing committees on education must hold a public hearing on
 12 22 the proposed assessments and post notice of the hearing 10 days
 12 23 prior to the hearing, and the general assembly and the governor
 12 24 must specifically authorize the assessments in the same manner
 12 25 as the state academic content standards.
 12 26    School districts must establish a fundamental academic
 12 27 curriculum for students enrolled in the school district in K=12
 12 28 that defines academic objectives to be achieved by all students
 12 29 and is based upon the school district's educational mission,
 12 30 long=range student goals and student performance objectives,
 12 31 and the state's graduation requirements.  The fundamental
 12 32 academic curriculum may vary from the state academic content
 12 33 standards adopted pursuant to this section.
 12 34    After consulting with the school district's teachers
 12 35 and administrators, the district must determine the aligned
 13  1 instructional program for delivering its fundamental academic
 13  2 curriculum and identify the courses and programs in which the
 13  3 fundamental academic curriculum will be taught.
 13  4    School districts must provide adequate time and transparency
 13  5 for public review and comment on the aligned instructional
 13  6 programs by all interested members of the community before
 13  7 final adoption of the fundamental academic curriculum.
 13  8    New Code section 256.25 includes language providing that
 13  9 the new Code section shall not be construed to promote any
 13 10 religious or nonreligious doctrine, promote discrimination
 13 11 for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or
 13 12 nonbeliefs, or promote discrimination for or against religion
 13 13 or nonreligion; and that the new Code section does not require
 13 14 any school district to utilize all or any part of the academic
 13 15 content standards adopted.  The state board and the department
 13 16 shall not impose any financial consequence on a school district
 13 17 that adopts academic content standards differing from those
 13 18 adopted and implemented under the new Code section.
 13 19    DIVISION II == ELIMINATING COMMON CORE REFERENCES
 13 20 == PROVIDING FOR RELATED MATTERS.  The bill eliminates
 13 21 requirements and references to the (Iowa) common core or
 13 22 core curriculum and to core content standards, but continues
 13 23 to direct the state board of education to adopt high school
 13 24 graduation requirements and assessment standards.
 13 25    Provisions directing school districts to cooperate with
 13 26 each eighth grade student on a core curriculum plan to meet
 13 27 core curriculum requirements are amended to replace "core
 13 28 curriculum plan" with "graduation plan" and "core curriculum
 13 29 requirements" with "high school graduation requirements".  The
 13 30 term "core content standards", which was used to describe the
 13 31 assessment standards adopted by the state board, is replaced
 13 32 with the term "assessment standards". The assessment standards
 13 33 will remain applicable to all students in kindergarten through
 13 34 grade 12 in every school district and accredited nonpublic
 13 35 school. Corresponding changes are made throughout the Code,
 14  1 and obsolete language is eliminated.

 10 15 educational initiative.
 10 16    DIVISION I == COMMON CORE STANDARDS PROHIBITED.  The bill
 10 17 establishes new Code section 256.25.  The new Code section
 10 18 prohibits the state board from adopting, aligning to, or
 10 19 implementing any other national or multistate consortium
 10 20 standards from any source requiring the use of any assessments
 10 21 aligned with any other national or multistate consortium
 10 22 standards from any source and requires the state board and
 10 23 the department to respect and support the ultimate right of a
 10 24 parent to opt the parent's child out of public school, and out
 10 25 of any public school activity, practice, or testing that the
 10 26 parent finds unacceptable, with no negative repercussions to,
 10 27 or financial impact on, the child, parent, or school, and with
 10 28 no interference from the state.
 10 29    Also, by January 1, 2018, for the school year beginning
 10 30 July 1, 2018, and each succeeding school year, the state board
 10 31 and the department must adopt and implement state academic
 10 32 content standards for kindergarten through grade twelve
 10 33 (K=12) in English language arts, mathematics, science, and
 10 34 social studies that are the same as the academic standards in
 10 35 effect for the state of Massachusetts during the academic year
 11  1 beginning July 1, 2008, except that any reference in those
 11  2 standards to the state of Massachusetts shall be changed to
 11  3 Iowa and any state history or government content standards
 11  4 shall be changed to reflect the history and government of
 11  5 Iowa.  The department shall distribute the standards to school
 11  6 districts and shall post the standards on the department's
 11  7 internet site within 10 days following adoption of the state
 11  8 academic content standards.  At the same time, the state
 11  9 board and the department must also adopt validated state
 11 10 assessments of student achievement based on the assessment used
 11 11 in Massachusetts during the 2008=2009 school year and aligned
 11 12 to the academic standards in effect in Massachusetts during the
 11 13 2008=2009 school year.
 11 14    The bill directs the state board, the department, and the
 11 15 director of the department, and any other state public employee
 11 16 or authority to take all steps necessary to terminate areas of
 11 17 federal control of the Iowa educational process; and prohibits
 11 18 these entities from adopting or implementing any national
 11 19 or multistate consortium standard from any source, or the
 11 20 use of any assessments aligned with a national or multistate
 11 21 consortium standard that cedes control of Iowa educational
 11 22 standards in any manner; or from joining any consortium or
 11 23 any other organization if participation in that consortium or
 11 24 organization would cede any measure of control over any aspect
 11 25 of Iowa public education to that consortium or organization.
 11 26 This state shall retain sole control over the development,
 11 27 establishment, and revision of course of study standards for
 11 28 K=12.
 11 29    After not less than five years and at the discretion of
 11 30 the state board, the state board may adopt state academic
 11 31 content standards to replace the standards that were based on
 11 32 Massachusetts' standards.  However, these replacement content
 11 33 standards must be developed independently and not as part of a
 11 34 multistate consortium.  Such content standards shall emphasize
 11 35 coherence, focus, and essential knowledge, have evidence of
 12  1 successful application and results, and may be administered
 12  2 using computer technology.  The department shall not implement
 12  3 the replacement content standards until the state board submits
 12  4 the content standards to the general assembly, the general
 12  5 assembly's standing committees on education hold a joint public
 12  6 hearing on the proposed content standards and provide public
 12  7 notice of the public hearing at least 10 days prior to the
 12  8 public hearing; and the content standards are specifically
 12  9 authorized by a constitutional majority of each house of the
 12 10 general assembly and approved by the governor.

 13 19    DIVISION II == ELIMINATING COMMON CORE REFERENCES
 13 20 == PROVIDING FOR RELATED MATTERS.  The bill eliminates
 13 21 requirements and references to the (Iowa) common core or
 13 22 core curriculum and to core content standards, but continues
 13 23 to direct the state board of education to adopt high school
 13 24 graduation requirements and assessment standards.
 13 25    Provisions directing school districts to cooperate with
 13 26 each eighth grade student on a core curriculum plan to meet
 13 27 core curriculum requirements are amended to replace "core
 13 28 curriculum plan" with "graduation plan" and "core curriculum
 13 29 requirements" with "high school graduation requirements".  The
 13 30 term "core content standards", which was used to describe the
 13 31 assessment standards adopted by the state board, is replaced
 13 32 with the term "assessment standards". The assessment standards
 13 33 will remain applicable to all students in kindergarten through
 13 34 grade 12 in every school district and accredited nonpublic
 13 35 school. Corresponding changes are made throughout the Code,
 14  1 and obsolete language is eliminated.

 10 16    DIVISION I == COMMON CORE STANDARDS PROHIBITED.  The bill
 10 17 establishes new Code section 256.25.  The new Code section
 10 18 prohibits the state board from adopting, aligning to, or
 10 19 implementing any other national or multistate consortium
 10 20 standards from any source requiring the use of any assessments
 10 21 aligned with any other national or multistate consortium
 10 22 standards from any source and requires the state board and
 10 23 the department to respect and support the ultimate right of a
 10 24 parent to opt the parent's child out of public school, and out
 10 25 of any public school activity, practice, or testing that the
 10 26 parent finds unacceptable, with no negative repercussions to,
 10 27 or financial impact on, the child, parent, or school, and with
 10 28 no interference from the state.
 10 29    Also, by January 1, 2018, for the school year beginning
 10 30 July 1, 2018, and each succeeding school year, the state board
 10 31 and the department must adopt and implement state academic
 10 32 content standards for kindergarten through grade twelve
 10 33 (K=12) in English language arts, mathematics, science, and
 10 34 social studies that are the same as the academic standards in
 10 35 effect for the state of Massachusetts during the academic year
 11  1 beginning July 1, 2008, except that any reference in those
 11  2 standards to the state of Massachusetts shall be changed to
 11  3 Iowa and any state history or government content standards
 11  4 shall be changed to reflect the history and government of
 11  5 Iowa.  The department shall distribute the standards to school
 11  6 districts and shall post the standards on the department's
 11  7 internet site within 10 days following adoption of the state
 11  8 academic content standards.  At the same time, the state
 11  9 board and the department must also adopt validated state
 11 10 assessments of student achievement based on the assessment used
 11 11 in Massachusetts during the 2008=2009 school year and aligned
 11 12 to the academic standards in effect in Massachusetts during the
 11 13 2008=2009 school year.
 11 14    The bill directs the state board, the department, and the
 11 15 director of the department, and any other state public employee
 11 16 or authority to take all steps necessary to terminate areas of
 11 17 federal control of the Iowa educational process; and prohibits
 11 18 these entities from adopting or implementing any national
 11 19 or multistate consortium standard from any source, or the
 11 20 use of any assessments aligned with a national or multistate
 11 21 consortium standard that cedes control of Iowa educational
 11 22 standards in any manner; or from joining any consortium or
 11 23 any other organization if participation in that consortium or
 11 24 organization would cede any measure of control over any aspect
 11 25 of Iowa public education to that consortium or organization.
 11 26 This state shall retain sole control over the development,
 11 27 establishment, and revision of course of study standards for
 11 28 K=12.
 11 29    After not less than five years and at the discretion of
 11 30 the state board, the state board may adopt state academic
 11 31 content standards to replace the standards that were based on
 11 32 Massachusetts' standards.  However, these replacement content
 11 33 standards must be developed independently and not as part of a
 11 34 multistate consortium.  Such content standards shall emphasize
 11 35 coherence, focus, and essential knowledge, have evidence of
 12  1 successful application and results, and may be administered
 12  2 using computer technology.  The department shall not implement
 12  3 the replacement content standards until the state board submits
 12  4 the content standards to the general assembly, the general
 12  5 assembly's standing committees on education hold a joint public
 12  6 hearing on the proposed content standards and provide public
 12  7 notice of the public hearing at least 10 days prior to the
 12  8 public hearing; and the content standards are specifically
 12  9 authorized by a constitutional majority of each house of the
 12 10 general assembly and approved by the governor.
 12 11    Each year, as soon as reasonably possible, the aggregated
 12 12 results shall be available on the department internet site
 12 13 for review by the public.  In collecting student achievement
 12 14 data for posting on the internet site, the department shall
 12 15 not collect data about the values, attitudes, beliefs, and
 12 16 personality traits of a student or the student's family or
 12 17 medical, behavioral, mental, biometric, or psychometric data of
 12 18 a student or of the student's family.
 12 19    Prior to implementing the proposed state assessments, the
 12 20 department must submit them to the general assembly, the
 12 21 standing committees on education must hold a public hearing on
 12 22 the proposed assessments and post notice of the hearing 10 days
 12 23 prior to the hearing, and the general assembly and the governor
 12 24 must specifically authorize the assessments in the same manner
 12 25 as the state academic content standards.
 12 26    School districts must establish a fundamental academic
 12 27 curriculum for students enrolled in the school district in K=12
 12 28 that defines academic objectives to be achieved by all students
 12 29 and is based upon the school district's educational mission,
 12 30 long=range student goals and student performance objectives,
 12 31 and the state's graduation requirements.  The fundamental
 12 32 academic curriculum may vary from the state academic content
 12 33 standards adopted pursuant to this section.
 12 34    After consulting with the school district's teachers
 12 35 and administrators, the district must determine the aligned
 13  1 instructional program for delivering its fundamental academic
 13  2 curriculum and identify the courses and programs in which the
 13  3 fundamental academic curriculum will be taught.
 13  4    School districts must provide adequate time and transparency

 10 17 establishes new Code section 256.25.  The new Code section
 10 18 prohibits the state board from adopting, aligning to, or
 10 19 implementing any other national or multistate consortium
 10 20 standards from any source requiring the use of any assessments
 10 21 aligned with any other national or multistate consortium
 10 22 standards from any source and requires the state board and
 10 23 the department to respect and support the ultimate right of a
 10 24 parent to opt the parent's child out of public school, and out
 10 25 of any public school activity, practice, or testing that the
 10 26 parent finds unacceptable, with no negative repercussions to,
 10 27 or financial impact on, the child, parent, or school, and with
 10 28 no interference from the state.
 10 29    Also, by January 1, 2018, for the school year beginning
 10 30 July 1, 2018, and each succeeding school year, the state board
 10 31 and the department must adopt and implement state academic
 10 32 content standards for kindergarten through grade twelve
 10 33 (K=12) in English language arts, mathematics, science, and
 10 34 social studies that are the same as the academic standards in
 10 35 effect for the state of Massachusetts during the academic year
 11  1 beginning July 1, 2008, except that any reference in those
 11  2 standards to the state of Massachusetts shall be changed to
 11  3 Iowa and any state history or government content standards
 11  4 shall be changed to reflect the history and government of
 11  5 Iowa.  The department shall distribute the standards to school
 11  6 districts and shall post the standards on the department's
 11  7 internet site within 10 days following adoption of the state
 11  8 academic content standards.  At the same time, the state
 11  9 board and the department must also adopt validated state
 11 10 assessments of student achievement based on the assessment used
 11 11 in Massachusetts during the 2008=2009 school year and aligned
 11 12 to the academic standards in effect in Massachusetts during the
 11 13 2008=2009 school year.
 11 14    The bill directs the state board, the department, and the
 11 15 director of the department, and any other state public employee
 11 16 or authority to take all steps necessary to terminate areas of
 11 17 federal control of the Iowa educational process; and prohibits
 11 18 these entities from adopting or implementing any national
 11 19 or multistate consortium standard from any source, or the
 11 20 use of any assessments aligned with a national or multistate
 11 21 consortium standard that cedes control of Iowa educational
 11 22 standards in any manner; or from joining any consortium or
 11 23 any other organization if participation in that consortium or
 11 24 organization would cede any measure of control over any aspect
 11 25 of Iowa public education to that consortium or organization.
 11 26 This state shall retain sole control over the development,
 11 27 establishment, and revision of course of study standards for
 11 28 K=12.
 11 29    After not less than five years and at the discretion of
 11 30 the state board, the state board may adopt state academic
 11 31 content standards to replace the standards that were based on
 11 32 Massachusetts' standards.  However, these replacement content
 11 33 standards must be developed independently and not as part of a
 11 34 multistate consortium.  Such content standards shall emphasize
 11 35 coherence, focus, and essential knowledge, have evidence of
 12  1 successful application and results, and may be administered
 12  2 using computer technology.  The department shall not implement
 12  3 the replacement content standards until the state board submits
 12  4 the content standards to the general assembly, the general
 12  5 assembly's standing committees on education hold a joint public
 12  6 hearing on the proposed content standards and provide public
 12  7 notice of the public hearing at least 10 days prior to the
 12  8 public hearing; and the content standards are specifically
 12  9 authorized by a constitutional majority of each house of the
 12 10 general assembly and approved by the governor.
 12 11    Each year, as soon as reasonably possible, the aggregated
 12 12 results shall be available on the department internet site
 12 13 for review by the public.  In collecting student achievement
 12 14 data for posting on the internet site, the department shall
 12 15 not collect data about the values, attitudes, beliefs, and
 12 16 personality traits of a student or the student's family or
 12 17 medical, behavioral, mental, biometric, or psychometric data of
 12 18 a student or of the student's family.
 12 19    Prior to implementing the proposed state assessments, the
 12 20 department must submit them to the general assembly, the
 12 21 standing committees on education must hold a public hearing on
 12 22 the proposed assessments and post notice of the hearing 10 days
 12 23 prior to the hearing, and the general assembly and the governor
 12 24 must specifically authorize the assessments in the same manner
 12 25 as the state academic content standards.
 12 26    School districts must establish a fundamental academic
 12 27 curriculum for students enrolled in the school district in K=12
 12 28 that defines academic objectives to be achieved by all students
 12 29 and is based upon the school district's educational mission,
 12 30 long=range student goals and student performance objectives,
 12 31 and the state's graduation requirements.  The fundamental
 12 32 academic curriculum may vary from the state academic content
 12 33 standards adopted pursuant to this section.
 12 34    After consulting with the school district's teachers
 12 35 and administrators, the district must determine the aligned
 13  1 instructional program for delivering its fundamental academic
 13  2 curriculum and identify the courses and programs in which the
 13  3 fundamental academic curriculum will be taught.
 13  4    School districts must provide adequate time and transparency
 13  5 for public review and comment on the aligned instructional
 13  6 programs by all interested members of the community before
 13  7 final adoption of the fundamental academic curriculum.
 13  8    New Code section 256.25 includes language providing that
 13  9 the new Code section shall not be construed to promote any
 13 10 religious or nonreligious doctrine, promote discrimination
 13 11 for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or
 13 12 nonbeliefs, or promote discrimination for or against religion
 13 13 or nonreligion; and that the new Code section does not require
 13 14 any school district to utilize all or any part of the academic
 13 15 content standards adopted.  The state board and the department
 13 16 shall not impose any financial consequence on a school district
 13 17 that adopts academic content standards differing from those
 13 18 adopted and implemented under the new Code section.
 13 19    DIVISION II == ELIMINATING COMMON CORE REFERENCES
 13 20 == PROVIDING FOR RELATED MATTERS.  The bill eliminates
 13 21 requirements and references to the (Iowa) common core or
 13 22 core curriculum and to core content standards, but continues
 13 23 to direct the state board of education to adopt high school
 13 24 graduation requirements and assessment standards.
 13 25    Provisions directing school districts to cooperate with
 13 26 each eighth grade student on a core curriculum plan to meet
 13 27 core curriculum requirements are amended to replace "core
 13 28 curriculum plan" with "graduation plan" and "core curriculum
 13 29 requirements" with "high school graduation requirements".  The
 13 30 term "core content standards", which was used to describe the
 13 31 assessment standards adopted by the state board, is replaced
 13 32 with the term "assessment standards". The assessment standards
 13 33 will remain applicable to all students in kindergarten through
 13 34 grade 12 in every school district and accredited nonpublic
 13 35 school. Corresponding changes are made throughout the Code,
 14  1 and obsolete language is eliminated.

 11 30 the state board, the state board may adopt state academic
 11 31 content standards to replace the standards that were based on
 11 32 Massachusetts' standards.  However, these replacement content
 11 33 standards must be developed independently and not as part of a
 11 34 multistate consortium.  Such content standards shall emphasize
 11 35 coherence, focus, and essential knowledge, have evidence of
 12  1 successful application and results, and may be administered
 12  2 using computer technology.  The department shall not implement
 12  3 the replacement content standards until the state board submits
 12  4 the content standards to the general assembly, the general
 12  5 assembly's standing committees on education hold a joint public
 12  6 hearing on the proposed content standards and provide public
 12  7 notice of the public hearing at least 10 days prior to the
 12  8 public hearing; and the content standards are specifically
 12  9 authorized by a constitutional majority of each house of the
 12 10 general assembly and approved by the governor.
 12 11    Each year, as soon as reasonably possible, the aggregated
 12 12 results shall be available on the department internet site
 12 13 for review by the public.  In collecting student achievement
 12 14 data for posting on the internet site, the department shall
 12 15 not collect data about the values, attitudes, beliefs, and
 12 16 personality traits of a student or the student's family or
 12 17 medical, behavioral, mental, biometric, or psychometric data of
 12 18 a student or of the student's family.
 12 19    Prior to implementing the proposed state assessments, the
 12 20 department must submit them to the general assembly, the
 12 21 standing committees on education must hold a public hearing on
 12 22 the proposed assessments and post notice of the hearing 10 days
 12 23 prior to the hearing, and the general assembly and the governor
 12 24 must specifically authorize the assessments in the same manner
 12 25 as the state academic content standards.
 12 26    School districts must establish a fundamental academic
 12 27 curriculum for students enrolled in the school district in K=12
 12 28 that defines academic objectives to be achieved by all students
 12 29 and is based upon the school district's educational mission,
 12 30 long=range student goals and student performance objectives,
 12 31 and the state's graduation requirements.  The fundamental
 12 32 academic curriculum may vary from the state academic content
 12 33 standards adopted pursuant to this section.
 12 34    After consulting with the school district's teachers
 12 35 and administrators, the district must determine the aligned
 13  1 instructional program for delivering its fundamental academic
 13  2 curriculum and identify the courses and programs in which the
 13  3 fundamental academic curriculum will be taught.
 13  4    School districts must provide adequate time and transparency
 13  5 for public review and comment on the aligned instructional
 13  6 programs by all interested members of the community before
 13  7 final adoption of the fundamental academic curriculum.
 13  8    New Code section 256.25 includes language providing that
 13  9 the new Code section shall not be construed to promote any
 13 10 religious or nonreligious doctrine, promote discrimination
 13 11 for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or
 13 12 nonbeliefs, or promote discrimination for or against religion
 13 13 or nonreligion; and that the new Code section does not require
 13 14 any school district to utilize all or any part of the academic
 13 15 content standards adopted.  The state board and the department
 13 16 shall not impose any financial consequence on a school district
 13 17 that adopts academic content standards differing from those
 13 18 adopted and implemented under the new Code section.
 13 19    DIVISION II == ELIMINATING COMMON CORE REFERENCES
 13 20 == PROVIDING FOR RELATED MATTERS.  The bill eliminates
 13 21 requirements and references to the (Iowa) common core or
 13 22 core curriculum and to core content standards, but continues
 13 23 to direct the state board of education to adopt high school
 13 24 graduation requirements and assessment standards.
 13 25    Provisions directing school districts to cooperate with
 13 26 each eighth grade student on a core curriculum plan to meet
 13 27 core curriculum requirements are amended to replace "core
 13 28 curriculum plan" with "graduation plan" and "core curriculum
 13 29 requirements" with "high school graduation requirements".  The
 13 30 term "core content standards", which was used to describe the
 13 31 assessment standards adopted by the state board, is replaced
 13 32 with the term "assessment standards". The assessment standards
 13 33 will remain applicable to all students in kindergarten through
 13 34 grade 12 in every school district and accredited nonpublic
 13 35 school. Corresponding changes are made throughout the Code,
 14  1 and obsolete language is eliminated.

 11  6 districts and shall post the standards on the department's
 11  7 internet site within 10 days following adoption of the state
 11  8 academic content standards.  At the same time, the state
 11  9 board and the department must also adopt validated state
 11 10 assessments of student achievement based on the assessment used
 11 11 in Massachusetts during the 2008=2009 school year and aligned
 11 12 to the academic standards in effect in Massachusetts during the

 13 30 term "core content standards", which was used to describe the
 13 31 assessment standards adopted by the state board, is replaced
 13 32 with the term "assessment standards". The assessment standards
 13 33 will remain applicable to all students in kindergarten through

 11  6 districts and shall post the standards on the department's
 11  7 internet site within 10 days following adoption of the state
 11  8 academic content standards.  At the same time, the state
 11  9 board and the department must also adopt validated state
 11 10 assessments of student achievement based on the assessment used
 11 11 in Massachusetts during the 2008=2009 school year and aligned

 11 33 standards must be developed independently and not as part of a
 11 34 multistate consortium.  Such content standards shall emphasize
 11 35 coherence, focus, and essential knowledge, have evidence of
 12  1 successful application and results, and may be administered
 12  2 using computer technology.  The department shall not implement
 12  3 the replacement content standards until the state board submits
 12  4 the content standards to the general assembly, the general
 12  5 assembly's standing committees on education hold a joint public
 12  6 hearing on the proposed content standards and provide public
 12  7 notice of the public hearing at least 10 days prior to the

 12  9 authorized by a constitutional majority of each house of the
 12 10 general assembly and approved by the governor.
 12 11    Each year, as soon as reasonably possible, the aggregated
 12 12 results shall be available on the department internet site

 12 14 data for posting on the internet site, the department shall
 12 15 not collect data about the values, attitudes, beliefs, and
 12 16 personality traits of a student or the student's family or

 12 28 that defines academic objectives to be achieved by all students
 12 29 and is based upon the school district's educational mission,
 12 30 long=range student goals and student performance objectives,
 12 31 and the state's graduation requirements.  The fundamental
 12 32 academic curriculum may vary from the state academic content
 12 33 standards adopted pursuant to this section.
 12 34    After consulting with the school district's teachers
 12 35 and administrators, the district must determine the aligned
 13  1 instructional program for delivering its fundamental academic
 13  2 curriculum and identify the courses and programs in which the
 13  3 fundamental academic curriculum will be taught.
 13  4    School districts must provide adequate time and transparency
 13  5 for public review and comment on the aligned instructional
 13  6 programs by all interested members of the community before
 13  7 final adoption of the fundamental academic curriculum.
 13  8    New Code section 256.25 includes language providing that

 13 10 religious or nonreligious doctrine, promote discrimination
 13 11 for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or

 12 28 that defines academic objectives to be achieved by all students
 12 29 and is based upon the school district's educational mission,
 12 30 long=range student goals and student performance objectives,
