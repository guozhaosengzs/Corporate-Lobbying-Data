 19 13 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 19 14 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 19 15    GENERAL.  This bill amends a number of provisions relating
 19 16 to agriculture and natural resources, including funding
 19 17 sources; and programs, projects, and practices (sustainable
 19 18 water initiatives) used to advance an Iowa water policy
 19 19 (policy) and the regulation of confinement feeding operations.
 19 20 The provisions affect a  number of agencies and political
 19 21 subdivisions, including the department of agriculture and land
 19 22 stewardship (DALS), the department of natural resources (DNR),
 19 23 the department of homeland security and emergency management
 19 24 (HSEMD), watershed management authorities (authorities), the
 19 25 Leopold center for sustainable agriculture (Leopold center),
 19 26 and the Iowa flood center (flood center).  The bill also refers
 19 27 to the Iowa water center, a federally funded entity housed
 19 28 within Iowa state university of science and technology. The
 19 29 bill creates an Iowa water commission (commission) within DNR.
 19 30    DIVISION I ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION ACT
 19 31 ==== INCREASE IN SALES AND USE TAX.  The bill increases from
 19 32 6 percent to 6.375 percent the state sales tax rate and the
 19 33 state use tax rate, and provides for the transfer of sales tax
 19 34 revenues to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
 19 35 fund (trust fund).  The bill also amends the transfer of use
 20  1 tax revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education
 20  2 fund (SAVE) in Code section 423F.2 from 1/6th (approximately
 20  3 16.66 percent) of the revenues to 15.6863 percent of the
 20  4 revenues to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 20  5 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 20  6 use tax rate increase provided in the bill.
 20  7    CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.  The bill relates to state sales
 20  8 and use taxes and to an amendment to the Iowa Constitution
 20  9 ratified on November 2, 2010, which created the trust fund
 20 10 and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the trust fund
 20 11 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality
 20 12 and natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and
 20 13 fish and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils
 20 14 in the state (Article VII, section 10).  The trust fund and
 20 15 appropriations from the trust fund are codified in Code chapter
 20 16 461.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount credited to the
 20 17 trust fund will be equal to the amount generated by an increase
 20 18 in the state sales tax rate occurring after the effective
 20 19 date of the constitutional amendment, but shall not exceed
 20 20 the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375 percent would
 20 21 generate.  The state sales tax rate has not been increased
 20 22 since the effective date of the constitutional amendment, so no
 20 23 amounts have been credited to the fund.

 21  4 provides that it is this state's policy to advance water
 21  5 sustainability.  The policy is divided between two categories:
 21  6 (1) water quality and (2) water management.  The water quality
 21  7 category states the importance of preserving, restoring, and
 21  8 enhancing surface water and groundwater (water resources).  The
 21  9 bill provides a schedule of objectives for the reduction of
 21 10 nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in this state's surface
 21 11 waters based on July 1 through June 30 fiscal years: (1) 2018
 21 12 through 2024, 20 percent, (2)  2024 through 2028, 32 percent,
 21 13 and (3) 2028 through 2033, 45 percent.  The water management
 21 14 category states the importance of preparing for and confronting
 21 15 the immediate and prolonged consequences to property caused by
 21 16 a flood or drought conditions.
 21 17    IOWA WATER POLICY ACT ==== COMMISSION.  The commission
 21 18 consists of members appointed by the governor who have

 21 23 seek staffing assistance from DALS and HSEMD.  It must also
 21 24 cooperate with the Leopold center, flood center, and Iowa water
 21 25 center.  The commission is required to establish a long=range
 21 26 comprehensive state water plan for each category and which
 21 27 accounts for factors and trends that are projected to impact
 21 28 water resources, including its uses. The commission must also
 21 29 prepare and submit annual updates to the plan.  It must include
 21 30 an assessment regarding the state's progress in achieving
 21 31 objectives, goals, and benchmarks; an evaluation of revenue
 21 32 used to support initiatives; a list of locations requiring
 21 33 immediate attention to comply with water quality objectives,
 21 34 goals, and benchmarks; research activities; an evaluation of
 21 35 sustainable water initiatives; a list of initiatives financed
 22  1 or to be financed by the commission; and recommendations
 22  2 regarding the revision of legal provisions or policies.
 22  3    IOWA WATER POLICY ACT ==== AUTHORITIES.  The bill authorizes
 22  4 the commission to allocate moneys to support administrative
 22  5 costs incurred by eligible authorities.  The bill also

 22 11 cooperation with the flood center, the commission, and the
 22 12 Iowa water center.  Under the program, the department and
 22 13 participating authorities must measure water levels in existing
 22 14 aquifer monitoring well systems, produce enhanced mapping
 22 15 of groundwater sources,  provide technical assistance for
 22 16 drought and water conservation planning, obtain short=term
 22 17 and long=term water conservation plans, and provide for the
 22 18 installation of a network of hydrologic monitoring stations
 22 19 capable of collecting relevant data.  DNR must prepare and
 22 20 submit an annual report to the governor and general assembly
 22 21 summarizing DNR's activities, assessments, and planning
 22 22 processes.
 22 23    DIVISION VII ==== ANIMAL AGRICULTURE COMPLIANCE ACT ====
 22 24 GENERAL.  The bill amends the "Animal Agriculture Compliance
 22 25 Act" (Code chapter 459) which generally regulates confinement
 22 26 feeding operations (operations) including associated
 22 27 confinement feeding operation structures (structures) by
 22 28 DNR.  The bill amends provisions requiring that an application
 22 29 to construct or expand a structure must be evaluated by a
 22 30 participating board of supervisors in the county where the
 22 31 structure is to be located. The evaluation process includes
 22 32 the scoring of criteria that is part of a master matrix

 22 35    ANIMAL AGRICULTURE COMPLIANCE ACT ==== MATRIX.  The bill
 23  1 provides that DNR is required to provide criteria with
 23  2 deductible points based on a number of factors including
 23  3 a substantial threat to the watershed, the failure of the
 23  4 owner of the operation to file a water quality improvement
 23  5 plan as required by DNR, the close proximity of a structure
 23  6 to a drinking water source, the relatively higher number
 23  7 of operations existing in the same watershed, and the lack
 23  8 of community support for the application as evidenced from
 23  9 comments made to a board during a public hearing.
 23 10    ANIMAL AGRICULTURE COMPLIANCE ACT ==== APPLICABILITY.  The
 23 11 bill's provisions do not apply to an application that is

 19 15    GENERAL.  This bill amends a number of provisions relating
 19 16 to agriculture and natural resources, including funding
 19 17 sources; and programs, projects, and practices (sustainable
 19 18 water initiatives) used to advance an Iowa water policy
 19 19 (policy) and the regulation of confinement feeding operations.
 19 20 The provisions affect a  number of agencies and political
 19 21 subdivisions, including the department of agriculture and land
 19 22 stewardship (DALS), the department of natural resources (DNR),
 19 23 the department of homeland security and emergency management
 19 24 (HSEMD), watershed management authorities (authorities), the
 19 25 Leopold center for sustainable agriculture (Leopold center),
 19 26 and the Iowa flood center (flood center).  The bill also refers
 19 27 to the Iowa water center, a federally funded entity housed
 19 28 within Iowa state university of science and technology. The
 19 29 bill creates an Iowa water commission (commission) within DNR.
 19 30    DIVISION I ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION ACT
 19 31 ==== INCREASE IN SALES AND USE TAX.  The bill increases from
 19 32 6 percent to 6.375 percent the state sales tax rate and the
 19 33 state use tax rate, and provides for the transfer of sales tax
 19 34 revenues to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
 19 35 fund (trust fund).  The bill also amends the transfer of use
 20  1 tax revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education
 20  2 fund (SAVE) in Code section 423F.2 from 1/6th (approximately
 20  3 16.66 percent) of the revenues to 15.6863 percent of the
 20  4 revenues to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 20  5 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 20  6 use tax rate increase provided in the bill.
 20  7    CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.  The bill relates to state sales
 20  8 and use taxes and to an amendment to the Iowa Constitution
 20  9 ratified on November 2, 2010, which created the trust fund
 20 10 and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the trust fund
 20 11 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality
 20 12 and natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and
 20 13 fish and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils
 20 14 in the state (Article VII, section 10).  The trust fund and
 20 15 appropriations from the trust fund are codified in Code chapter
 20 16 461.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount credited to the
 20 17 trust fund will be equal to the amount generated by an increase
 20 18 in the state sales tax rate occurring after the effective
 20 19 date of the constitutional amendment, but shall not exceed
 20 20 the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375 percent would
 20 21 generate.  The state sales tax rate has not been increased
 20 22 since the effective date of the constitutional amendment, so no
 20 23 amounts have been credited to the fund.

 21 23 seek staffing assistance from DALS and HSEMD.  It must also
 21 24 cooperate with the Leopold center, flood center, and Iowa water
 21 25 center.  The commission is required to establish a long=range
 21 26 comprehensive state water plan for each category and which
 21 27 accounts for factors and trends that are projected to impact
 21 28 water resources, including its uses. The commission must also

 22 13 participating authorities must measure water levels in existing
 22 14 aquifer monitoring well systems, produce enhanced mapping
 22 15 of groundwater sources,  provide technical assistance for
 22 16 drought and water conservation planning, obtain short=term
 22 17 and long=term water conservation plans, and provide for the
 22 18 installation of a network of hydrologic monitoring stations
 22 19 capable of collecting relevant data.  DNR must prepare and
 22 20 submit an annual report to the governor and general assembly
 22 21 summarizing DNR's activities, assessments, and planning
 22 22 processes.
 22 23    DIVISION VII ==== ANIMAL AGRICULTURE COMPLIANCE ACT ====

 23  3 a substantial threat to the watershed, the failure of the
 23  4 owner of the operation to file a water quality improvement
 23  5 plan as required by DNR, the close proximity of a structure
 23  6 to a drinking water source, the relatively higher number
 23  7 of operations existing in the same watershed, and the lack
 23  8 of community support for the application as evidenced from
 23  9 comments made to a board during a public hearing.
 23 10    ANIMAL AGRICULTURE COMPLIANCE ACT ==== APPLICABILITY.  The

 19 15    GENERAL.  This bill amends a number of provisions relating
 19 16 to agriculture and natural resources, including funding
 19 17 sources; and programs, projects, and practices (sustainable
 19 18 water initiatives) used to advance an Iowa water policy
 19 19 (policy) and the regulation of confinement feeding operations.
 19 20 The provisions affect a  number of agencies and political
 19 21 subdivisions, including the department of agriculture and land
 19 22 stewardship (DALS), the department of natural resources (DNR),
 19 23 the department of homeland security and emergency management
 19 24 (HSEMD), watershed management authorities (authorities), the
 19 25 Leopold center for sustainable agriculture (Leopold center),
 19 26 and the Iowa flood center (flood center).  The bill also refers
 19 27 to the Iowa water center, a federally funded entity housed
 19 28 within Iowa state university of science and technology. The
 19 29 bill creates an Iowa water commission (commission) within DNR.
 19 30    DIVISION I ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION ACT
 19 31 ==== INCREASE IN SALES AND USE TAX.  The bill increases from
 19 32 6 percent to 6.375 percent the state sales tax rate and the
 19 33 state use tax rate, and provides for the transfer of sales tax
 19 34 revenues to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
 19 35 fund (trust fund).  The bill also amends the transfer of use
 20  1 tax revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education
 20  2 fund (SAVE) in Code section 423F.2 from 1/6th (approximately
 20  3 16.66 percent) of the revenues to 15.6863 percent of the
 20  4 revenues to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 20  5 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 20  6 use tax rate increase provided in the bill.
 20  7    CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.  The bill relates to state sales
 20  8 and use taxes and to an amendment to the Iowa Constitution
 20  9 ratified on November 2, 2010, which created the trust fund
 20 10 and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the trust fund
 20 11 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality
 20 12 and natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and
 20 13 fish and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils
 20 14 in the state (Article VII, section 10).  The trust fund and
 20 15 appropriations from the trust fund are codified in Code chapter
 20 16 461.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount credited to the
 20 17 trust fund will be equal to the amount generated by an increase
 20 18 in the state sales tax rate occurring after the effective
 20 19 date of the constitutional amendment, but shall not exceed
 20 20 the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375 percent would
 20 21 generate.  The state sales tax rate has not been increased

 20  3 16.66 percent) of the revenues to 15.6863 percent of the
 20  4 revenues to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 20  5 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 20  6 use tax rate increase provided in the bill.
 20  7    CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.  The bill relates to state sales
 20  8 and use taxes and to an amendment to the Iowa Constitution

 20 11 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality
 20 12 and natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and
 20 13 fish and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils
 20 14 in the state (Article VII, section 10).  The trust fund and
 20 15 appropriations from the trust fund are codified in Code chapter
 20 16 461.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount credited to the
 20 17 trust fund will be equal to the amount generated by an increase
 20 18 in the state sales tax rate occurring after the effective
 20 19 date of the constitutional amendment, but shall not exceed
 20 20 the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375 percent would
 20 21 generate.  The state sales tax rate has not been increased

 20 14 in the state (Article VII, section 10).  The trust fund and
 20 15 appropriations from the trust fund are codified in Code chapter
 20 16 461.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount credited to the
 20 17 trust fund will be equal to the amount generated by an increase
 20 18 in the state sales tax rate occurring after the effective
 20 19 date of the constitutional amendment, but shall not exceed
 20 20 the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375 percent would
 20 21 generate.  The state sales tax rate has not been increased

 19 33 state use tax rate, and provides for the transfer of sales tax
 19 34 revenues to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
 19 35 fund (trust fund).  The bill also amends the transfer of use
 20  1 tax revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education
 20  2 fund (SAVE) in Code section 423F.2 from 1/6th (approximately
 20  3 16.66 percent) of the revenues to 15.6863 percent of the
 20  4 revenues to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 20  5 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 20  6 use tax rate increase provided in the bill.
 20  7    CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.  The bill relates to state sales
 20  8 and use taxes and to an amendment to the Iowa Constitution
 20  9 ratified on November 2, 2010, which created the trust fund
 20 10 and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the trust fund
 20 11 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality
 20 12 and natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and
 20 13 fish and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils
 20 14 in the state (Article VII, section 10).  The trust fund and
 20 15 appropriations from the trust fund are codified in Code chapter
 20 16 461.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount credited to the
 20 17 trust fund will be equal to the amount generated by an increase
 20 18 in the state sales tax rate occurring after the effective
 20 19 date of the constitutional amendment, but shall not exceed
 20 20 the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375 percent would
 20 21 generate.  The state sales tax rate has not been increased
 20 22 since the effective date of the constitutional amendment, so no

 23  3 a substantial threat to the watershed, the failure of the
 23  4 owner of the operation to file a water quality improvement
 23  5 plan as required by DNR, the close proximity of a structure
 23  6 to a drinking water source, the relatively higher number
 23  7 of operations existing in the same watershed, and the lack
 23  8 of community support for the application as evidenced from
 23  9 comments made to a board during a public hearing.
 23 10    ANIMAL AGRICULTURE COMPLIANCE ACT ==== APPLICABILITY.  The

 19 30    DIVISION I ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION ACT
 19 31 ==== INCREASE IN SALES AND USE TAX.  The bill increases from
 19 32 6 percent to 6.375 percent the state sales tax rate and the
 19 33 state use tax rate, and provides for the transfer of sales tax
 19 34 revenues to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
 19 35 fund (trust fund).  The bill also amends the transfer of use
 20  1 tax revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education
 20  2 fund (SAVE) in Code section 423F.2 from 1/6th (approximately
 20  3 16.66 percent) of the revenues to 15.6863 percent of the
 20  4 revenues to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 20  5 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 20  6 use tax rate increase provided in the bill.
 20  7    CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.  The bill relates to state sales
 20  8 and use taxes and to an amendment to the Iowa Constitution
 20  9 ratified on November 2, 2010, which created the trust fund
 20 10 and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the trust fund
 20 11 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality
 20 12 and natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and
 20 13 fish and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils
 20 14 in the state (Article VII, section 10).  The trust fund and
 20 15 appropriations from the trust fund are codified in Code chapter
 20 16 461.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount credited to the
 20 17 trust fund will be equal to the amount generated by an increase
 20 18 in the state sales tax rate occurring after the effective
 20 19 date of the constitutional amendment, but shall not exceed
 20 20 the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375 percent would
 20 21 generate.  The state sales tax rate has not been increased
 20 22 since the effective date of the constitutional amendment, so no
 20 23 amounts have been credited to the fund.

 22 23    DIVISION VII ==== ANIMAL AGRICULTURE COMPLIANCE ACT ====
 22 24 GENERAL.  The bill amends the "Animal Agriculture Compliance
 22 25 Act" (Code chapter 459) which generally regulates confinement
 22 26 feeding operations (operations) including associated
 22 27 confinement feeding operation structures (structures) by

 22 29 to construct or expand a structure must be evaluated by a
 22 30 participating board of supervisors in the county where the
 22 31 structure is to be located. The evaluation process includes
 22 32 the scoring of criteria that is part of a master matrix
 22 33 (matrix). The bill revises scoring procedures and the types of
 22 34 criteria that must be included in the matrix.
 22 35    ANIMAL AGRICULTURE COMPLIANCE ACT ==== MATRIX.  The bill
 23  1 provides that DNR is required to provide criteria with
 23  2 deductible points based on a number of factors including
 23  3 a substantial threat to the watershed, the failure of the
 23  4 owner of the operation to file a water quality improvement
 23  5 plan as required by DNR, the close proximity of a structure
 23  6 to a drinking water source, the relatively higher number
 23  7 of operations existing in the same watershed, and the lack
 23  8 of community support for the application as evidenced from
 23  9 comments made to a board during a public hearing.
 23 10    ANIMAL AGRICULTURE COMPLIANCE ACT ==== APPLICABILITY.  The
 23 11 bill's provisions do not apply to an application that is
 23 12 pending approval or disapproval by DNR immediately prior to the

 19 30    DIVISION I ==== NATURAL RESOURCES AND OUTDOOR RECREATION ACT
 19 31 ==== INCREASE IN SALES AND USE TAX.  The bill increases from
 19 32 6 percent to 6.375 percent the state sales tax rate and the
 19 33 state use tax rate, and provides for the transfer of sales tax
 19 34 revenues to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
 19 35 fund (trust fund).  The bill also amends the transfer of use
 20  1 tax revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education
 20  2 fund (SAVE) in Code section 423F.2 from 1/6th (approximately
 20  3 16.66 percent) of the revenues to 15.6863 percent of the
 20  4 revenues to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 20  5 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 20  6 use tax rate increase provided in the bill.
 20  7    CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.  The bill relates to state sales
 20  8 and use taxes and to an amendment to the Iowa Constitution
 20  9 ratified on November 2, 2010, which created the trust fund
 20 10 and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the trust fund
 20 11 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality
 20 12 and natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and
 20 13 fish and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils
 20 14 in the state (Article VII, section 10).  The trust fund and
 20 15 appropriations from the trust fund are codified in Code chapter
 20 16 461.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount credited to the
 20 17 trust fund will be equal to the amount generated by an increase
 20 18 in the state sales tax rate occurring after the effective
 20 19 date of the constitutional amendment, but shall not exceed
 20 20 the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375 percent would
 20 21 generate.  The state sales tax rate has not been increased
 20 22 since the effective date of the constitutional amendment, so no
 20 23 amounts have been credited to the fund.

 22 25 Act" (Code chapter 459) which generally regulates confinement
 22 26 feeding operations (operations) including associated
 22 27 confinement feeding operation structures (structures) by
 22 28 DNR.  The bill amends provisions requiring that an application
 22 29 to construct or expand a structure must be evaluated by a
 22 30 participating board of supervisors in the county where the
 22 31 structure is to be located. The evaluation process includes
 22 32 the scoring of criteria that is part of a master matrix
 22 33 (matrix). The bill revises scoring procedures and the types of
 22 34 criteria that must be included in the matrix.

 23  1 provides that DNR is required to provide criteria with
 23  2 deductible points based on a number of factors including
 23  3 a substantial threat to the watershed, the failure of the
 23  4 owner of the operation to file a water quality improvement
 23  5 plan as required by DNR, the close proximity of a structure
 23  6 to a drinking water source, the relatively higher number
 23  7 of operations existing in the same watershed, and the lack
 23  8 of community support for the application as evidenced from
 23  9 comments made to a board during a public hearing.

 19 32 6 percent to 6.375 percent the state sales tax rate and the
 19 33 state use tax rate, and provides for the transfer of sales tax
 19 34 revenues to the natural resources and outdoor recreation trust
 19 35 fund (trust fund).  The bill also amends the transfer of use
 20  1 tax revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education
 20  2 fund (SAVE) in Code section 423F.2 from 1/6th (approximately
 20  3 16.66 percent) of the revenues to 15.6863 percent of the
 20  4 revenues to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 20  5 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 20  6 use tax rate increase provided in the bill.
 20  7    CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.  The bill relates to state sales
 20  8 and use taxes and to an amendment to the Iowa Constitution
 20  9 ratified on November 2, 2010, which created the trust fund
 20 10 and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the trust fund
 20 11 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality
 20 12 and natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and
 20 13 fish and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils
 20 14 in the state (Article VII, section 10).  The trust fund and
 20 15 appropriations from the trust fund are codified in Code chapter
 20 16 461.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount credited to the
 20 17 trust fund will be equal to the amount generated by an increase
 20 18 in the state sales tax rate occurring after the effective
 20 19 date of the constitutional amendment, but shall not exceed
 20 20 the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375 percent would
 20 21 generate.  The state sales tax rate has not been increased
 20 22 since the effective date of the constitutional amendment, so no
 20 23 amounts have been credited to the fund.

 20  1 tax revenues to the secure an advanced vision for education
 20  2 fund (SAVE) in Code section 423F.2 from 1/6th (approximately
 20  3 16.66 percent) of the revenues to 15.6863 percent of the
 20  4 revenues to ensure that SAVE receives approximately the same
 20  5 proportion of the total use tax revenue as it did prior to the
 20  6 use tax rate increase provided in the bill.
 20  7    CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.  The bill relates to state sales
 20  8 and use taxes and to an amendment to the Iowa Constitution
 20  9 ratified on November 2, 2010, which created the trust fund
 20 10 and dedicated a portion of state revenues to the trust fund
 20 11 for the purposes of protecting and enhancing water quality
 20 12 and natural areas in the state including parks, trails, and
 20 13 fish and wildlife habitat, and conserving agricultural soils
 20 14 in the state (Article VII, section 10).  The trust fund and
 20 15 appropriations from the trust fund are codified in Code chapter
 20 16 461.  Pursuant to the amendment, the amount credited to the
 20 17 trust fund will be equal to the amount generated by an increase
 20 18 in the state sales tax rate occurring after the effective
 20 19 date of the constitutional amendment, but shall not exceed
 20 20 the amount that a state sales tax rate of 0.375 percent would
 20 21 generate.  The state sales tax rate has not been increased
 20 22 since the effective date of the constitutional amendment, so no
 20 23 amounts have been credited to the fund.
