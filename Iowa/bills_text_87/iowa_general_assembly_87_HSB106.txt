EXPLANATION
3


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
4


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
5


Under
current
law,
evidence
of
failure
to
wear
a
motor
6


vehicle
safety
belt
or
safety
harness
as
required
by
Code
7


section
321.445(2)
may
be
used
to
mitigate
damages
in
a
civil
8


case
upon
a
showing
of
substantial
evidence
that
the
failure
9


to
wear
a
safety
belt
or
safety
harness
contributed
to
the
10


injuries
claimed.
In
addition,
current
law
provides
that
11


the
maximum
amount
which
damages
may
be
reduced
for
failure
12


to
wear
a
motor
vehicle
safety
belt
or
safety
harness
is
5
13


percent
of

This

14


statutory
five

limitation
on
such
damages
reduction
15


for
persons
who
are
16
years
old
or
older

have

instruction
permit
under
Code
section
321.180B(1)
or
17


a
special
minor’s
license
under
Code
section
321.194.
As
a
18


result,
a
jury
may
decide
to
reduce
damages
awarded
by
more
19


than
5
percent
for
failure
to
wear
a
motor
vehicle
safety
belt
20


or
safety
harness.
21


Current
law
provides
that
evidence
of
a
failure
to
use
a
22


child
restraint
system,
safety
belts,
or
safety
harnesses
23


for
persons
under
the
age
of
18,
as
required
by
Code
section
24


321.446(6),
does
not
constitute
negligence
nor
is
such
evidence
25


admissible
in
a
civil
action.
A
child
restraint
system
is
a
26


specially
designed
seating
system,
including
a
belt-positioning
27


seat
or
a
booster
seat,
that
meets
federal
motor
vehicle
safety
28


standards.
The
bill
eliminates
the
prohibition
on
introducing
29


such
evidence
for
persons
who
are
16
years
old
or
older
and
30


for
persons
who
have
an
instruction
permit
under
Code
section
31


321.180B(1)
or
a
special
minor’s
license
under
Code
section
32


321.194.
