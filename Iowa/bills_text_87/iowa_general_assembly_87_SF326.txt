  4  3 often made from a variety of natural sources, used for a broad
  4  4 range of diseases or conditions, particularly chronic, serious,
  4  5 or life=threatening conditions such as cancer and rheumatoid
  4  6 arthritis.
  4  7    The bill provides that pharmacists may use professional

  4 10 The bill requires the board of pharmacy to maintain a link
  4 11 on its internet site to the current list of all biological
  4 12 products that the United States food and drug administration
  4 13 has determined to be interchangeable biological products.

  4 15 an interchangeable biological product if the prescriber
  4 16 specifically indicates that no product selection shall be made
  4 17 or the person presenting the prescription indicates that only
  4 18 the specific biological product prescribed should be dispensed.
  4 19    The bill removes a provision that requires a pharmacist
  4 20 to pass on to the patient no less than 50 percent of the

  4 22 prescribed and the drug substituted and inform a patient of
  4 23 those savings if the pharmacist makes a drug product selection.

  4 25 the pharmacist selects a generically equivalent drug product or
  4 26 an interchangeable biological product.
  4 27    The bill requires that within five days of dispensing an

  4 29 an entry into one of a specified type of electronic records
  4 30 systems noting the name and manufacturer of the biological

  4 34 provide the name and manufacturer of the biological product to
  4 35 the prescriber. Such communication is not required if a refill

  5  3    A person who violates these provisions with regard to
  5  4 a noncontrolled substance shall be guilty of a serious
