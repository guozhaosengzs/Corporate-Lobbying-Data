  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to public education funding by extending
  4  1 the period of time for collecting sales tax for deposit in
  4  2 the secure an advanced vision for education (SAVE) fund,
  4  3 authorizing uses for funding received from the fund, and
  4  4 authorizing school districts to adopt a district cost per pupil
  4  5 equity budget adjustment.
  4  6    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
  4  7 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
  4  8 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
  4  9 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
  4 10 consumers, unless specifically exempted by statute.  Generally,
  4 11 by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax is also
  4 12 subject to the use tax. Following the transfer of amounts
  4 13 required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of the remaining
  4 14 state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax is transferred
  4 15 to the SAVE fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in
  4 16 the SAVE fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil
  4 17 basis to be used for infrastructure and property tax relief
  4 18 purposes specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law,
  4 19 the sales tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on
  4 20 January 1, 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other
  4 21 corresponding provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  4 22    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  4 23 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  4 24 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  4 25    The bill establishes a district cost per pupil equity budget
  4 26 adjustment.  The board of directors of a school district with
  4 27 a regular program district cost per pupil that is less than
  4 28 the highest regular program district cost per pupil among all
  4 29 school districts in the state for the same budget year may
  4 30 annually adopt a resolution to receive the budget adjustment
  4 31 authorized in the bill.
  4 32    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018,
  4 33 an eligible school district that has approved the budget
  4 34 adjustment shall receive a budget adjustment in an amount not
  4 35 to exceed the difference between the school district's regular
  5  1 program district cost per pupil and the highest regular program
  5  2 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the state
  5  3 multiplied by the district's weighted enrollment.  The bill
  5  4 requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment by
  5  5 using moneys received from the SAVE fund. Amounts used to fund
  5  6 the budget adjustment may be used for any school general fund
  5  7 purpose.
  5  8    The bill specifies that the budget adjustment received does
  5  9 not affect the eligibility for or amount of any other budget
  5 10 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  5 11 the amount of the budget adjustment shall not be included in
  5 12 any computation of a school district's cost for any future
  5 13 budget year.
  5 14    As part of the restrictions on the use of revenues received
  5 15 from the SAVE fund, Code section 423F.3 defines "school
  5 16 infrastructure". The bill authorizes additional purposes for
  5 17 which a school district may use funds received from the SAVE
  5 18 fund by modifying the definition of "school infrastructure".
  5 19 Those additional purposes are: (1) transportation costs of
  5 20 a school district; (2) costs of funding a district cost per
  5 21 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
  5 22 (3) costs incurred by a school district to administer certain
  5 23 student achievement assessments.
  5 24    Code section 423F.3, subsection 7, provides that the general
  5 25 assembly shall not alter the purposes for which SAVE fund
  5 26 revenues received may be used from infrastructure and property
  5 27 tax relief purposes to any other purpose unless the bill is
  5 28 approved by a vote of at least two=thirds of the members of
  5 29 both chambers of the general assembly and is signed by the
  5 30 governor. The bill specifies that such approval requirement
  5 31 does not apply to the bill.

  4 16 the SAVE fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil
  4 17 basis to be used for infrastructure and property tax relief
  4 18 purposes specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law,
  4 19 the sales tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on
  4 20 January 1, 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other
  4 21 corresponding provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  4 22    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  4 23 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  4 24 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  4 25    The bill establishes a district cost per pupil equity budget
  4 26 adjustment.  The board of directors of a school district with
  4 27 a regular program district cost per pupil that is less than
  4 28 the highest regular program district cost per pupil among all
  4 29 school districts in the state for the same budget year may

  4 31 authorized in the bill.
  4 32    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018,
  4 33 an eligible school district that has approved the budget
  4 34 adjustment shall receive a budget adjustment in an amount not
  4 35 to exceed the difference between the school district's regular
  5  1 program district cost per pupil and the highest regular program
  5  2 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the state
  5  3 multiplied by the district's weighted enrollment.  The bill
  5  4 requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment by
  5  5 using moneys received from the SAVE fund. Amounts used to fund
  5  6 the budget adjustment may be used for any school general fund
  5  7 purpose.
  5  8    The bill specifies that the budget adjustment received does
  5  9 not affect the eligibility for or amount of any other budget
  5 10 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  5 11 the amount of the budget adjustment shall not be included in
  5 12 any computation of a school district's cost for any future
  5 13 budget year.
  5 14    As part of the restrictions on the use of revenues received
  5 15 from the SAVE fund, Code section 423F.3 defines "school
  5 16 infrastructure". The bill authorizes additional purposes for
  5 17 which a school district may use funds received from the SAVE
  5 18 fund by modifying the definition of "school infrastructure".
  5 19 Those additional purposes are: (1) transportation costs of
  5 20 a school district; (2) costs of funding a district cost per
  5 21 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and

  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to public education funding by extending
  4  1 the period of time for collecting sales tax for deposit in
  4  2 the secure an advanced vision for education (SAVE) fund,
  4  3 authorizing uses for funding received from the fund, and
  4  4 authorizing school districts to adopt a district cost per pupil
  4  5 equity budget adjustment.
  4  6    Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
  4  7 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
  4  8 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
  4  9 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to
  4 10 consumers, unless specifically exempted by statute.  Generally,
  4 11 by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales tax is also
  4 12 subject to the use tax. Following the transfer of amounts
  4 13 required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of the remaining
  4 14 state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax is transferred
  4 15 to the SAVE fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in
  4 16 the SAVE fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil
  4 17 basis to be used for infrastructure and property tax relief
  4 18 purposes specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law,
  4 19 the sales tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on
  4 20 January 1, 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other
  4 21 corresponding provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  4 22    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  4 23 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  4 24 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  4 25    The bill establishes a district cost per pupil equity budget
  4 26 adjustment.  The board of directors of a school district with
  4 27 a regular program district cost per pupil that is less than
  4 28 the highest regular program district cost per pupil among all
  4 29 school districts in the state for the same budget year may
  4 30 annually adopt a resolution to receive the budget adjustment
  4 31 authorized in the bill.
  4 32    For budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2018,
  4 33 an eligible school district that has approved the budget
  4 34 adjustment shall receive a budget adjustment in an amount not
  4 35 to exceed the difference between the school district's regular
  5  1 program district cost per pupil and the highest regular program
  5  2 district cost per pupil among all school districts in the state
  5  3 multiplied by the district's weighted enrollment.  The bill
  5  4 requires the school district to fund the budget adjustment by
  5  5 using moneys received from the SAVE fund. Amounts used to fund
  5  6 the budget adjustment may be used for any school general fund
  5  7 purpose.
  5  8    The bill specifies that the budget adjustment received does
  5  9 not affect the eligibility for or amount of any other budget
  5 10 adjustment authorized by law for the same budget year and that
  5 11 the amount of the budget adjustment shall not be included in
  5 12 any computation of a school district's cost for any future
  5 13 budget year.
  5 14    As part of the restrictions on the use of revenues received
  5 15 from the SAVE fund, Code section 423F.3 defines "school
  5 16 infrastructure". The bill authorizes additional purposes for
  5 17 which a school district may use funds received from the SAVE
  5 18 fund by modifying the definition of "school infrastructure".
  5 19 Those additional purposes are: (1) transportation costs of
  5 20 a school district; (2) costs of funding a district cost per
  5 21 pupil equity budget adjustment, as authorized in the bill; and
  5 22 (3) costs incurred by a school district to administer certain
  5 23 student achievement assessments.
  5 24    Code section 423F.3, subsection 7, provides that the general
  5 25 assembly shall not alter the purposes for which SAVE fund
  5 26 revenues received may be used from infrastructure and property
