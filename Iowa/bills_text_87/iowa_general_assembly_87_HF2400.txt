  1 30                           EXPLANATION
  1 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 33    This bill requires a person operating a motor vehicle
  1 34 involved in a motor vehicle accident who leaves the scene of
  1 35 the accident without knowledge that the accident resulted in
  2  1 injury to or death of another person to give notice of the
  2  2 accident to the sheriff of the county in which the accident
  2  3 occurred, or the nearest office of the state patrol, or to any
  2  4 other peace officer as near as practicable to the place where
  2  5 the accident occurred immediately after the person obtains
  2  6 knowledge that the accident resulted in injury to or death of
  2  7 another person or that the accident was of such a nature that a
  2  8 reasonable person would anticipate that the accident resulted
  2  9 in injury to or death of another person.
  2 10    A person who violates the provisions of the bill is guilty of
  2 11 a serious misdemeanor if the accident resulted in an injury, an
  2 12 aggravated misdemeanor if the accident resulted in a serious
  2 13 injury, or a class "D" felony if the accident resulted in a
  2 14 death. A serious misdemeanor is punishable by a fine of at
  2 15 least $315 but not to exceed $1,875 and imprisonment not to
  2 16 exceed one year. An aggravated misdemeanor is punishable by a
  2 17 fine of at least $625 but not to exceed $6,250 and imprisonment
  2 18 not to exceed two years. A class "D" felony is punishable by a
  2 19 fine of at least $750 but not to exceed $7,500 and imprisonment
  2 20 not to exceed five years.
  2 21    The bill prohibits a person charged with a violation of
  2 22 the bill from being charged with a violation of Code section
  2 23 321.261 (accidents resulting in injury or death), 321.263
  2 24 (information and aid == leaving the scene of a personal injury
  2 25 accident), or 321.266 (reporting accidents) based on the same
  2 26 set of facts and circumstances.
  2 27    Under current law, Code section 321.209 provides a list of
  2 28 convictions for which a person is subject to mandatory driver's
  2 29 license revocation by the department of transportation (DOT),
  2 30 including convictions for failure to stop and render aid in
  2 31 the event of a motor vehicle accident resulting in the death
  2 32 or personal injury of another. The bill adds convictions
  2 33 for violations of the provisions of the bill to the list.
  2 34 The bill requires the DOT to revoke the driver's license or
  2 35 operating privilege of a person who violates the provisions
  3  1 of the bill upon 30 days' notice and without preliminary
  3  2 hearing upon receiving a record of the person's conviction
  3  3 when such conviction has become final. By operation of law,
  3  4 Code section 321.212 provides that the DOT shall not grant an
  3  5 application for a new driver's license to the person until
  3  6 the expiration of one year after the revocation. During the
  3  7 revocation period, the person is eligible for a temporary
  3  8 restricted license under Code section 321.215(1). Under
  3  9 current law, a person convicted for failure to stop and render
  3 10 aid in the event of a motor vehicle accident resulting in the
  3 11 death or personal injury of another is eligible for a temporary
  3 12 restricted license under Code section 321.215(2).
