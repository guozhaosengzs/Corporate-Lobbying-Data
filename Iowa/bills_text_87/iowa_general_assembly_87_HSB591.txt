EXPLANATION

The
inclusion

this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
11


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
12


This
bill
modifies
various
provisions
relating
to
the
13


utilities
division
of
the
department
of
commerce.
14


Current
law
requires
the
Iowa
utilities
board
to
appoint
an
15


executive
secretary,
whose
salary
is
set
by
the
board
and
who
16


takes
the
same
oath
as
board
members.
The
bill
requires
the
17


board
to
appoint
a
chief
operating
officer
(COO)
instead
of
18


an
executive
secretary.
The
bill
specifies
that
the
role
of
19


the
COO
is
to
manage
the
operations
of
the
utilities
division
20


as
directed
by
the
board.
The
bill
provides
that
the
board
21


shall
set
the
salary
of
the
COO
within
the
limits
of
the
22


law
and
authorizes
the
board
to
employ
additional
personnel
23


as
necessary.
The
bill
replaces
references
to
“executive
24


secretary”
with
“COO”
in
the
Code.
25


Current
law
disqualifies
a
person
owning
any
bonds,
stock,
26


or
property
in
any
railroad
company
from
holding
office
in
the
27


utilities
board.
The
bill
removes
this
disqualification.
28


The
bill
removes
or
replaces
references
in
the
Code
to
29


repealed
Code
section
476.29,
which
required
telecommunications
30


service
providers
to
obtain
certification
from
the
board.
31


The
bill
removes
the
requirement
for
the
board
to
provide
32


the
general
assembly
with
a
report
on
certain
energy
efficiency
33


planning
efforts
to
be
completed
by

nuclear

in

Current

to

attributable
to
its
duties
to
a
person
bringing
a

expenses
7


attributable
to
its
duties
to
a
person
subject

Current
law
requires
the
board
to
specify
certain
ratemaking
10


principles
that
will
apply
to
certain
electric
generating
and
11


transmission
facilities.
In
doing
so
the
board
must
find
12


that
a
public
utility
has
demonstrated
to
the
board,
through
13


a
competitive
bidding
process
under
rules
adopted
by
the
14


board,
that
its
facility
or
lease
is
reasonable.
The
bill
15


removes
the
requirement
that
a
public
utility
demonstrate
the
16


reasonableness
of
its
facility
or
lease
through
a
competitive
17


bidding
process
under
rules
adopted
by
the
board.
18


The
bill
expands
the
definition
of
“public
utility”
in
Code
19


section
476.72,
which
is
applicable
to
certain
provisions
20


relating
to
public
utility
affiliates
and
reorganization,
to
21


also
include
rate-regulated
public
utilities
providing
water,
22


sanitary
sewage,
or
storm
water
drainage
services.
23


The
bill
requires
telecommunications
services
providers
24


offering
communications
service
telephone
numbers
to
retail
25


customers
in
the
state
to
register
annually
with
the
board.
26


An
applicant
must
complete
an
application
for
registration
27


on
a
form
provided
by
the
board,
which
shall
include
contact
28


information,
the
approximate
number
of
service
lines
provided
29


in
the
state,
and
any
other
information
deemed
necessary
30


by
the
board.
The
board
may
charge
an
annual
registration
31


fee
at
a
rate
deemed
reasonably
necessary
by
the
board.
32


If
a
person
fails
to
pay
an
annual
registration
fee,
the
33


application
or
registration
lapses
and
becomes
ineffective.

The

a
nonexclusive
acknowledgment
of
compliance
within
3


five
business
days
of
the
receipt
of
a
completed

Such

shall
authorize
the

interconnect
with
other

telecommunications
providers,
cross
railroad
rights-of-way,
7


and
provide
telecommunications

in
the
state.
An
8


acknowledgment
is
transferrable
by
filing
a
new
or
updated
9


registration
board.
A
registrant
shall
submit
corrections
to
10


the
registration
form
within
a
reasonable
time
after
a
change
11


in
circumstances
if
such
information
would
be
required
to
be
12


reported
in
an
application.
Failure
to
file
and
maintain
an
13


annual
registration
subjects
a
telecommunications
services
14


provider
to
a
civil
penalty
under
Code
section
476.51.
15


Current
law
requires
the
board
to
impose
an
annual
16


assessment
upon
all
telecommunications
carriers
in
the
state
17


to
fund
dual
party
relay
service
programs,
with
the
assessment
18


rate
depending
on
the
type
of
telecommunications
carrier.
The
19


bill
applies
the
same
assessment
rate
to
all
telecommunications
20


carriers
providing
service
in
the
state,
including
but
not
21


limited
to
wireless,
wireline,
and
alternative
operator
service
22


providers,
at
a
rate
of
three
cents
for
each
communications
23


service
telephone
number
provided
in
the
state.
24


Current
law
requires
pipeline
companies
doing
business
in
25


the
state
to
pay
the
board
an
annual
inspection
fee
of
50
26


cents
for
each
mile
of
pipeline
located
in
the
state.
The
27


bill
removes
this
set
fee
and
instead
allows
the
board
to


28


charge
pipeline
companies
with
annual
inspection
fees
that
are
29


directly
attributable
to
the
costs
of
conducting
inspections.
30


Current
law
allows
a
landowner
to
petition
the
county
31


board
of
supervisors
to
appoint
a
compensation
commission
to
32


determine
damages
arising
from
the
construction
of
certain
33


pipelines
if
the
landowner
and
pipeline
company
are
unable
to
34


agree
on
damages.

of
damages
exceeds
110
percent
of
the
pipeline
company’s
final

offer
prior
to
the
assessment,
the
pipeline
company
must
pay
2


all
costs
of
the
assessment,
including
costs
incurred
by
the

landowner;
if
the
assessment
does
not

final
offer
prior
to
the
assessment,
5


the
landowner
must
pay
the
costs

by
the
pipeline
6


company.
The
bill
removes
provisions
requiring
a
landowner
to
7


pay
the
costs
incurred
by
a
pipeline
company
if
a
compensation
8


commission’s
assessment
of
damages
does
not
exceed
110
percent
9


of
the
pipeline
company’s
final
offer
prior
to
such
assessment.
