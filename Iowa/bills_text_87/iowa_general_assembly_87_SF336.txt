  5  4 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  5 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      4 26    1.  As used in this section:
  4 27    a.  "Intellectually disabled" means the same as defined in
  4 28 section 902.15.
  4 29    b.  "Mentally ill" or "mental illness" means the same as
  4 30 defined in section 902.15.
  4 31    2.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has
  4 32 been filed, objections to the imposition of the death penalty
  4 33 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 34 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  4 35 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  1 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  2 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  3 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  4 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  5 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      4 27    a.  "Intellectually disabled" means the same as defined in
  4 28 section 902.15.
  4 29    b.  "Mentally ill" or "mental illness" means the same as
  4 30 defined in section 902.15.
  4 31    2.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has
  4 32 been filed, objections to the imposition of the death penalty
  4 33 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 34 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  4 35 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  1 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  2 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  3 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  4 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  5 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      4 28 section 902.15.
  4 29    b.  "Mentally ill" or "mental illness" means the same as
  4 30 defined in section 902.15.
  4 31    2.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has
  4 32 been filed, objections to the imposition of the death penalty
  4 33 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 34 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  4 35 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  1 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  2 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  3 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  4 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  5 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      4 29    b.  "Mentally ill" or "mental illness" means the same as
  4 30 defined in section 902.15.
  4 31    2.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has
  4 32 been filed, objections to the imposition of the death penalty
  4 33 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 34 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  4 35 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  1 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  2 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  3 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  4 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  5 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      4 30 defined in section 902.15.
  4 31    2.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has
  4 32 been filed, objections to the imposition of the death penalty
  4 33 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 34 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  4 35 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  1 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  2 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  3 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  4 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  5 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      4 31    2.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has
  4 32 been filed, objections to the imposition of the death penalty
  4 33 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 34 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  4 35 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  1 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  2 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  3 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  4 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  5 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      4 32 been filed, objections to the imposition of the death penalty
  4 33 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 34 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  4 35 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  1 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  2 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  3 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  4 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  5 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      4 33 based upon allegations that a defendant was intellectually
  4 34 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  4 35 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  1 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  2 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  3 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  4 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  5 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      4 34 disabled or mentally ill at the time of the commission of
  4 35 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  1 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  2 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  3 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  4 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  5 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      4 35 the offense shall be raised within the time provided for the
  5  1 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  2 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  3 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  4 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  5 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5  1 filing of pretrial motions under rule of criminal procedure
  5  2 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  3 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  4 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  5 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5  2 2.11, Iowa court rules.  The court may, for good cause shown,
  5  3 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  4 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  5 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5  3 allow late filing of the motion.  Hearing on the motion shall
  5  4 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  5 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5  4 be held prior to trial and the burden of proof shall be on the
  5  5 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or

 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.

  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been

  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and

  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5  6 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  5  7 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's

  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of

  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under

  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant

  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5  8 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.  If the
  5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the

  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be

  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury

  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant

 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5  9 court finds that the defendant is intellectually disabled,
  5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction

  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and

  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 10 the defendant, if convicted of the multiple offense of murder
  5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, shall not be sentenced
  5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 12 to death but shall be sentenced to life imprisonment in the
  5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the

 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 13 manner provided in section 902.1.  A finding by the court that
  5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been

  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence

  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the

  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 14 the evidence presented by the defendant at the hearing does
  5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each

 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 15 not preclude the imposition of the death penalty under this
  5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been

  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the

  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 16 section and section 902.15 shall not preclude the introduction
  5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous

 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded

 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 17 of evidence of intellectual disability or mental illness during
  5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under

  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and

  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the

  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the

  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 18 the penalty proceeding.  If the court finds that evidence of
  5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 19 intellectual disability or mental illness does not preclude
  5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 20 imposition of the death penalty, evidence of intellectual
  5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the

 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 21 disability or mental illness may be reviewed by the jury in
  5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of

  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent

  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or

  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive

  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 22 the penalty proceeding and the jury shall not be informed of
  5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 23 the finding in the initial proceeding at any time during the
  5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state

  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been

  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the

  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section

  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder

  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant

  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without

  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 24 penalty proceeding.
  5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 25    3.  If at the trial on a charge of the multiple offense
  5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state

  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to

  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present

  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant

  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under

 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's

 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 26 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, the state
  5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under
  5 28 section 902.1B, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent
  5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 27 intends to request that the death penalty be imposed under

  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a

  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted

  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 29 to seek the death penalty, at the time of and as part of the
  5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the

  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a

  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns

 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the

 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 30 information or indictment filed in the case.
  5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section

  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 31    4.  If a notice of intent to seek the death penalty has been
  5 32 filed, the trial shall be conducted in bifurcated proceedings
  5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the

  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of

  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant

  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence

  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing

  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 33 before the same trier of fact.  During the initial proceeding,
  5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 34 the jury, or the court if the defendant waives the right to a
  5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section

  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the

  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the

  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      5 35 jury trial, shall decide only whether the defendant is guilty
  6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6  1 or not guilty of the multiple offense of murder and sexual
  6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6  2 abuse under section 902.15.
  6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6  3    a.  If, in the initial proceeding, the court or jury finds
  6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6  4 the defendant guilty of, or the defendant pleads guilty to,
  6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6  5 an offense other than the multiple offense of murder and
  6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6  6 sexual abuse under section 902.15, the court shall sentence
  6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6  7 the defendant in accordance with the sentencing procedures set
  6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6  8 forth in rule of criminal procedure 2.23, Iowa court rules, and
  6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6  9 chapters 901 through 909, which are applicable to the offense.
  6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 10    b.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of, or
  6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 11 the defendant pleads guilty to, the multiple offense of murder
  6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present

  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant

  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the

  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme

  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness

  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the

  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not

  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be

  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 12 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, but the prosecuting
  6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 13 attorney waives the death penalty, the court shall sentence
  6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the
  6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the

  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be

  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be

  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a

  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there

 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open

 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 14 the defendant to life imprisonment in accordance with the

  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the

  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 15 sentencing procedures set forth in rule of criminal procedure
  6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 16 2.23, Iowa court rules, and chapters 901 through 909, which
  6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 17 are otherwise applicable to convictions of murder in the first
  6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 18 degree and sexual abuse.
  6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the

  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of

  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be

  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.

  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the

  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a

  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or

 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the

 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 19    c.  If the court or jury finds the defendant guilty of the
  6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section

  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant

  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple

  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 20 multiple offense of murder and sexual abuse under section
  6 21 902.15, or a defendant enters a plea of guilty in the initial
  6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the

 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.

 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any

 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as

 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 22 proceeding, and the prosecuting attorney does not waive
  6 23 imposition of the death penalty, a penalty proceeding shall be
  6 24 held in the manner provided in subsections 5 through 13.
  6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.

  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 25    5.  No sooner than twenty=four hours after a verdict of
  6 26 guilty or a plea of guilty to the multiple offense of murder
  6 27 and sexual abuse under section 902.15 is returned in the
  6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or

 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the

  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not

  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in

  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 28 initial proceeding, a penalty proceeding shall be held to
  6 29 determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death
  6 30 or to life imprisonment.  The proceeding shall be conducted
  6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing

  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected

  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant

  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or

 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall

 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open

  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 31 in the trial court before the trial jury, or the court if the
  6 32 defendant has waived the right to a jury trial or has waived
  6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties

  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.

  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness

  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not

  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,

  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the

 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      6 33 the right for the proceeding to be before the trial jury.  Both
  6 34 the state and the defendant shall have the right to present
  6 35 opening statements at the commencement of the proceeding.  In
  7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as

 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      7  1 the proceeding, evidence relevant to the existence of any
  7  2 aggravating or mitigating circumstances may be presented as
  7  3 follows:
  7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.

  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.

  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,

  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      7  4    a.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7  5 to the conviction of the multiple offense enumerated in section
  7  6 902.15 and any aggravating circumstances other than juvenile
  7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:

  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness

  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness

  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult

  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of

  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      7  7 delinquency adjudications for offenses which carry penalties
  7  8 equivalent to the penalties imposed for simple or serious
  7  9 misdemeanors.  The state may introduce evidence of the actual
  7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:

  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant

  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a

  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to

  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be

  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by

  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the

  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      7 10 harm caused by the commission of the multiple offense of murder
  7 11 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, including but not
  7 12 limited to evidence relating to the life of the victim and the
  7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.

  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.

  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the

  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of

  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be

  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or

  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the

 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      7 13 impact of the loss of the victim to the victim's family and
  7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      7 14 society.
  7 15    b.  The defendant may present evidence that the defendant
  7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the

  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:

  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.

  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there

 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a

  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,

  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by

  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:

  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".

  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.

  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      7 16 was intellectually disabled or mentally ill at the time of the
  7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      7 17 commission of the offense.  The burden of proof shall be on the
  7 18 defendant to prove intellectual disability or mental illness
  7 19 by a preponderance of the evidence.  However, a rebuttable
  7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each

  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      7 20 presumption of intellectual disability arises if a defendant
  7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      7 21 has an intelligence quotient of seventy=five or below.
  7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any

 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any

 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      7 22    c.  The state or the defendant may present evidence relevant
  7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      7 23 to any mitigating circumstances which may exist. Mitigating
  7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      7 24 circumstances may include the following circumstances:
  7 25    (1)  The defendant was under the influence of an extreme
  7 26 mental or emotional disturbance insufficient to constitute a
  7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:

  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall

 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded

 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the

 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:

  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,

  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a

  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".

  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence
  8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      7 27 defense.
  7 28    (2)  The age of the defendant at the time of the offense.
  7 29    (3)  The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness
  7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple
  8  4 offense of murder and sexual abuse and the defendant did not
  8  5 intend to kill or anticipate that lethal force would be used.
  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and

  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected

  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.

  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference

  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".

  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant

 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      7 30 of the defendant's conduct and to conform that conduct to the
  7 31 requirements of law was significantly impaired as a result of a
  7 32 mental disease or defect or intellectual disability, but not to
  7 33 a degree sufficient to constitute a defense.
  7 34    (4)  The defendant has no significant history of prior adult
  7 35 criminal activity.
  8  1    (5)  The defendant acted under extreme duress or under the
  8  2 substantial domination of another person.
  8  3    (6)  The defendant did not directly commit the multiple

  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and
  8 10 present arguments for or against a sentence of death.  Evidence

  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,
  8 13 except that introduction of evidence secured in violation of
  8 14 the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of
  8 15 the State of Iowa shall not be permitted.
  8 16    6.  At the conclusion of presentation of evidence in
  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the

  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded

 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as

  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns

  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and

  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns

 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life

 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended

  8  6    (7)  Any other factor which is relevant to the defendant's
  8  7 character or record or to the circumstances of the offense.
  8  8    d.  The state and the defendant or the defendant's counsel
  8  9 shall be permitted to present and cross=examine witnesses and

  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be

  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.

  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the

  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".

  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a

  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The

  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall

 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.

  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be

  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.

  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.

 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      8 11 regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances shall not
  8 12 be governed by the rules governing admissibility of evidence,

  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:

  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be

  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the

  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,

  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.

  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".

  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under

 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended

  8 17 the penalty proceeding, the state and the defendant or the
  8 18 defendant's counsel shall be permitted to make closing
  8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The

  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if

  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a

  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or

 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under

 10 35      8 19 arguments, including any rebuttal arguments, in the same manner
  8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      8 20 as in the initial proceeding and the following issues shall be
  8 21 determined by the jury or the court if there is no jury:
  8 22    a.  Whether the aggravating circumstance or circumstances
  8 23 have been established beyond a reasonable doubt and outweigh
  8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the

  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or

 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any

  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be

  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the

  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant

  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the

  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,

  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the

  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant

 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall

 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      8 24 any one or more mitigating circumstances.
  8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      8 25    b.  Whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death.
  8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of
 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      8 26    7.  A recommendation for a sentence of death shall not be
  8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in
 10  8 section 902.1, even if the jury or the court returns unanimous
 10  9 affirmative findings on each of the issues submitted under
 10 10 subsection 6.
 10 11    12.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
 10 12 a negative finding on any of the issues submitted under
 10 13 subsection 6, paragraph "a" or "b", the court shall enter a
 10 14 judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant to life
 10 15 imprisonment as provided in section 902.1.
 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any

 10 32 the jurors, the court shall discharge the jury.
 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      8 27 permitted if the recommendation is based on the race, color,
  8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under
  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or

  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".
  9 24    10.  If the jury, or the court if there is no jury, returns
  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant

  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special

 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded

 10 33    Sec. 7.  Section 902.1, subsection 1, Code 2017, is amended
 10 34 to read as follows:
 10 35      8 28 religious beliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant
  8 29 or of any victim, or based on any other protected class under

  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or

  8 30 chapter 216.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  8 31 return of a finding in the penalty proceeding, if the matter
  8 32 is tried before a jury, the court shall instruct the jury
  8 33 that in considering whether a sentence of death is justified,
  8 34 the jury shall not consider race, color, religious beliefs,
  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The
  9  2 court shall further instruct the jury that the jury shall not
  9  3 return a sentence of death unless the jury concludes that such
  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the
  9  8 commencement of the jury deliberations in the penalty
  9  9 proceeding, the court shall instruct the jury that if the
  9 10 defendant is not sentenced to death, the court is required by
  9 11 law to impose a sentence of imprisonment until death without
  9 12 parole.  The court shall further instruct the jury that
  9 13 the sentence of imprisonment until death without parole is
  9 14 required by law if the jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict
  9 15 recommending a sentence of death.
  9 16    9.  Concurrently with the return of the findings on the
  9 17 issues submitted under subsection 6, the jury, or the court if
  9 18 there is no jury, shall return special verdicts as follows:
  9 19    a.  Which aggravating circumstances were established beyond a
  9 20 reasonable doubt and were considered in reaching the verdict.
  9 21    b.  Which mitigating circumstances were established and
  9 22 were considered in reaching the verdict returned on the issue
  9 23 specified in subsection 6, paragraph "a".

  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant
  9 28 to death as provided in section 902.1B.
  9 29    11.  However, if evidence that the defendant was not a
  9 30 major participant in the commission of the multiple offense
  9 31 of murder and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the
  9 32 defendant's conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference
  9 33 to human life is presented to the jury, or the court if there
  9 34 is no jury, the jury or the court shall also return a special
  9 35 verdict on the issue.  If the jury unanimously determines, or
 10  1 the court if there is no jury, finds that a preponderance of
 10  2 evidence exists that shows that the defendant was not a major
 10  3 participant in the commission of the multiple offense of murder
 10  4 and sexual abuse under section 902.15, and that the defendant's
 10  5 conduct did not manifest a reckless indifference to human
 10  6 life, the court shall enter a judgment of conviction and shall
 10  7 sentence the defendant to life imprisonment as provided in

 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each

  8 35 national origin, or sex of the defendant or of any victim, or
  9  1 consider any other protected class under chapter 216.  The

  9  4 a sentence would be recommended no matter what the race, color,
  9  5 religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other protected
  9  6 class of the defendant or of any victim may be.
  9  7    8.  After submission of the issues, but prior to the

  9 25 a unanimous affirmative finding on each of the issues submitted
  9 26 under subsection 6, paragraphs "a" and "b", the court shall
  9 27 enter a judgment of conviction and shall sentence the defendant

 10 16    13.  After a verdict has been rendered it shall be recorded
 10 17 on the jury verdict form and shall be read and recorded in open
 10 18 court.  The jurors shall be collectively asked by the court
 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each
 10 22 juror shall be separately asked whether the verdict rendered by
 10 23 the jury foreperson is the juror's true and correct verdict.
 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any
 10 28 juror has been subjected to coercion or has become confused
 10 29 during the jury deliberation process.  The court may, as
 10 30 appropriate, direct the jury to resume deliberation in the
 10 31 case.  If no disagreement on the verdict is expressed by any of

 10 19 whether the verdict returned is their true and correct verdict.
 10 20 Even though no juror makes any declaration to the contrary, the
 10 21 jury shall, if either party so requests, be polled and each

 10 24 If, upon either the collective or the separate inquiry, any
 10 25 juror denies that the verdict is the juror's verdict, the court
 10 26 shall refuse to accept the verdict.  The court may direct
 10 27 inquiry or permit inquiry by counsel to ascertain whether any

 18 23    Sec. 17.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  This Act takes effect January 1,

 18 27                           EXPLANATION
 18 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 30    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 31 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 18 32 first degree and sexual abuse committed by a person age 18 or
 18 33 older with respect to the same victim if the trial jury, or
 18 34 the judge if there is no jury, makes specific findings and
 18 35 whether the jury believes the defendant should be put to death
 19  1 in a separate penalty proceeding held after the close of the
 19  2 initial trial proceeding.  Under the bill, a death sentence
 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the
 19  4 first degree and the state pleads and proves the defendant also
 19  5 committed sexual abuse against the murder victim.
 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19  7 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 24 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 26 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 27 mandate included in the bill.
 21 28    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 29 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 30 committed on or after that date.

 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),

 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,

 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,

 18 27                           EXPLANATION
 18 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 30    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 31 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 18 32 first degree and sexual abuse committed by a person age 18 or
 18 33 older with respect to the same victim if the trial jury, or
 18 34 the judge if there is no jury, makes specific findings and
 18 35 whether the jury believes the defendant should be put to death
 19  1 in a separate penalty proceeding held after the close of the
 19  2 initial trial proceeding.  Under the bill, a death sentence
 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the
 19  4 first degree and the state pleads and proves the defendant also
 19  5 committed sexual abuse against the murder victim.
 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19  7 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

 18 27                           EXPLANATION
 18 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 30    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 31 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 18 32 first degree and sexual abuse committed by a person age 18 or
 18 33 older with respect to the same victim if the trial jury, or
 18 34 the judge if there is no jury, makes specific findings and
 18 35 whether the jury believes the defendant should be put to death
 19  1 in a separate penalty proceeding held after the close of the
 19  2 initial trial proceeding.  Under the bill, a death sentence
 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the
 19  4 first degree and the state pleads and proves the defendant also
 19  5 committed sexual abuse against the murder victim.
 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19  7 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 24 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 26 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 27 mandate included in the bill.
 21 28    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 29 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 30 committed on or after that date.

 18 27                           EXPLANATION
 18 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 30    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 31 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 18 32 first degree and sexual abuse committed by a person age 18 or
 18 33 older with respect to the same victim if the trial jury, or
 18 34 the judge if there is no jury, makes specific findings and
 18 35 whether the jury believes the defendant should be put to death
 19  1 in a separate penalty proceeding held after the close of the
 19  2 initial trial proceeding.  Under the bill, a death sentence
 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the
 19  4 first degree and the state pleads and proves the defendant also
 19  5 committed sexual abuse against the murder victim.
 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19  7 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 24 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 26 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 27 mandate included in the bill.
 21 28    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 29 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 30 committed on or after that date.

 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court

 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other

 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to

 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a

 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced

 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence

 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not

 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial

 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

 18 32 first degree and sexual abuse committed by a person age 18 or
 18 33 older with respect to the same victim if the trial jury, or
 18 34 the judge if there is no jury, makes specific findings and
 18 35 whether the jury believes the defendant should be put to death
 19  1 in a separate penalty proceeding held after the close of the
 19  2 initial trial proceeding.  Under the bill, a death sentence
 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the
 19  4 first degree and the state pleads and proves the defendant also
 19  5 committed sexual abuse against the murder victim.
 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19  7 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 24 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 26 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 27 mandate included in the bill.
 21 28    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 29 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 30 committed on or after that date.

 18 30    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 31 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 18 32 first degree and sexual abuse committed by a person age 18 or

 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court

 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or

 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury

 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the

 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain

 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically

 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code

 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 24 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 26 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 27 mandate included in the bill.
 21 28    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 29 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 30 committed on or after that date.

 18 27                           EXPLANATION
 18 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 30    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 31 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 18 32 first degree and sexual abuse committed by a person age 18 or
 18 33 older with respect to the same victim if the trial jury, or
 18 34 the judge if there is no jury, makes specific findings and
 18 35 whether the jury believes the defendant should be put to death
 19  1 in a separate penalty proceeding held after the close of the
 19  2 initial trial proceeding.  Under the bill, a death sentence
 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the
 19  4 first degree and the state pleads and proves the defendant also
 19  5 committed sexual abuse against the murder victim.
 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19  7 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane

 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or

 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a

 18 31 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the

 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the
 19  4 first degree and the state pleads and proves the defendant also
 19  5 committed sexual abuse against the murder victim.
 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19  7 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme

 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing

 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a

 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 24 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 26 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 27 mandate included in the bill.

 18 27                           EXPLANATION
 18 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 30    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 31 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 18 32 first degree and sexual abuse committed by a person age 18 or
 18 33 older with respect to the same victim if the trial jury, or
 18 34 the judge if there is no jury, makes specific findings and
 18 35 whether the jury believes the defendant should be put to death
 19  1 in a separate penalty proceeding held after the close of the
 19  2 initial trial proceeding.  Under the bill, a death sentence
 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the
 19  4 first degree and the state pleads and proves the defendant also
 19  5 committed sexual abuse against the murder victim.
 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19  7 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 26 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 27 mandate included in the bill.
 21 28    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect

 18 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 30    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 31 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 18 32 first degree and sexual abuse committed by a person age 18 or
 18 33 older with respect to the same victim if the trial jury, or

 18 35 whether the jury believes the defendant should be put to death
 19  1 in a separate penalty proceeding held after the close of the
 19  2 initial trial proceeding.  Under the bill, a death sentence
 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the
 19  4 first degree and the state pleads and proves the defendant also
 19  5 committed sexual abuse against the murder victim.
 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19  7 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 24 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 26 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 27 mandate included in the bill.
 21 28    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect

 18 35 whether the jury believes the defendant should be put to death
 19  1 in a separate penalty proceeding held after the close of the
 19  2 initial trial proceeding.  Under the bill, a death sentence
 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the
 19  4 first degree and the state pleads and proves the defendant also
 19  5 committed sexual abuse against the murder victim.
 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19  7 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 24 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 26 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 27 mandate included in the bill.
 21 28    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 29 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 30 committed on or after that date.

 18 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 30    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 31 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 18 32 first degree and sexual abuse committed by a person age 18 or
 18 33 older with respect to the same victim if the trial jury, or
 18 34 the judge if there is no jury, makes specific findings and
 18 35 whether the jury believes the defendant should be put to death
 19  1 in a separate penalty proceeding held after the close of the
 19  2 initial trial proceeding.  Under the bill, a death sentence
 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the

 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence

 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 24 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 26 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 27 mandate included in the bill.

 18 27                           EXPLANATION
 18 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 30    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 31 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 18 32 first degree and sexual abuse committed by a person age 18 or
 18 33 older with respect to the same victim if the trial jury, or
 18 34 the judge if there is no jury, makes specific findings and
 18 35 whether the jury believes the defendant should be put to death
 19  1 in a separate penalty proceeding held after the close of the
 19  2 initial trial proceeding.  Under the bill, a death sentence
 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the
 19  4 first degree and the state pleads and proves the defendant also
 19  5 committed sexual abuse against the murder victim.
 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19  7 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a

 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 24 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 26 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 27 mandate included in the bill.
 21 28    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 29 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses

 18 26 committed on or after the effective date of this Act.
 18 27                           EXPLANATION
 18 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 18 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 18 30    This bill amends the Iowa criminal code to provide for
 18 31 punishment by death for the multiple offense of murder in the
 18 32 first degree and sexual abuse committed by a person age 18 or
 18 33 older with respect to the same victim if the trial jury, or
 18 34 the judge if there is no jury, makes specific findings and
 18 35 whether the jury believes the defendant should be put to death
 19  1 in a separate penalty proceeding held after the close of the
 19  2 initial trial proceeding.  Under the bill, a death sentence
 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the
 19  4 first degree and the state pleads and proves the defendant also
 19  5 committed sexual abuse against the murder victim.
 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19  7 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.

 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not

 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the

 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing

 18 35 whether the jury believes the defendant should be put to death
 19  1 in a separate penalty proceeding held after the close of the
 19  2 initial trial proceeding.  Under the bill, a death sentence
 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the
 19  4 first degree and the state pleads and proves the defendant also
 19  5 committed sexual abuse against the murder victim.
 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19  7 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 24 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 26 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 27 mandate included in the bill.
 21 28    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 29 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 30 committed on or after that date.

 18 32 first degree and sexual abuse committed by a person age 18 or
 18 33 older with respect to the same victim if the trial jury, or
 18 34 the judge if there is no jury, makes specific findings and
 18 35 whether the jury believes the defendant should be put to death
 19  1 in a separate penalty proceeding held after the close of the
 19  2 initial trial proceeding.  Under the bill, a death sentence
 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the
 19  4 first degree and the state pleads and proves the defendant also
 19  5 committed sexual abuse against the murder victim.
 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19  7 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,

 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 24 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 26 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 27 mandate included in the bill.
 21 28    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 29 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 30 committed on or after that date.

 19  3 could be imposed if the murder would constitute murder in the

 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of

 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 24 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 26 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 27 mandate included in the bill.
 21 28    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 29 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses
 21 30 committed on or after that date.

 19  6    The bill provides that in order to receive a sentence of
 19  7 death, the defendant must be at least 18 years of age at the
 19  8 time the offense is committed, must not be mentally ill or
 19  9 intellectually disabled, and must have been a major participant
 19 10 in the commission of the crime or must have shown a manifest
 19 11 indifference to human life.
 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.

 19 12    If a person is indigent and is charged with capital murder,
 19 13 payment of costs for two attorneys is authorized.  The supreme
 19 14 court is required to establish standards for the competency of
 19 15 counsel in death penalty cases.  The state public defender is
 19 16 charged with establishing teams of qualified lead and cocounsel
 19 17 for death penalty cases, as well as conducting or sponsoring
 19 18 specialized training programs for attorneys representing
 19 19 persons who may be executed.
 19 20    If such a case proceeds to trial and a notice of intent
 19 21 to seek the death penalty has been filed, in addition to
 19 22 any other defenses which may be presented to the charge, the
 19 23 defendant may raise the issue of intellectual disability or
 19 24 mental illness during the time of filing pretrial motions,
 19 25 and the defendant is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of
 19 26 intellectual disability if the defendant establishes that the
 19 27 defendant has an intelligence quotient of 75 or below.
 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or
 19 33 of any victim is not to be considered.  The supreme court
 19 34 shall collect evidence relating to whether the death sentences
 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the
 20  1 influence of prejudice at trial which will be available to
 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.
 21  5 The bill requires the board of corrections to adopt rules
 21  6 pertaining to executions, including rules pertaining to the
 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against

 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the
 20 35 supreme court may remand the case back to district court for a
 21  1 new sentencing hearing.  The bill requires the supreme court to
 21  2 examine whether the sentence is excessive or disproportionate
 21  3 to penalties in similar cases.  If affirmed by the supreme
 21  4 court, the penalty would be accomplished by lethal injection.

 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.
 21 16    The bill strikes provisions in Code section 902.1(2), (3),
 21 17 and (4) relating to juvenile class "A" felons and reinserts the
 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.
 21 21    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 21 22 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 21 23 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 21 24 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 21 25 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 21 26 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 21 27 mandate included in the bill.
 21 28    The bill contains severability provisions and takes effect
 21 29 January 1, 2018, and applies only to applicable offenses

 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or

 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have

 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the

 19 28    Once the evidence is submitted to the jury, the court
 19 29 will instruct the jury, at the defendant's request, that in
 19 30 considering whether a sentence of death is justified, the
 19 31 race, color, religious beliefs, national origin, sex, or other
 19 32 protected classes under Code chapter 216 of the defendant or

 19 35 imposed are excessive, disproportionate, or imposed under the

 20  2 litigants.
 20  3    The sentence of death is imposed only when the trier of fact
 20  4 (the jury or the court if the defendant has waived the right to
 20  5 a jury trial) unanimously answers two questions affirmatively:
 20  6 (1) whether aggravating circumstances established beyond a
 20  7 reasonable doubt outweigh any mitigating circumstances that
 20  8 may exist; and (2) whether the defendant should be sentenced
 20  9 to death.  Mitigating factors the trier of fact may consider
 20 10 include the following:  the defendant was under the influence
 20 11 of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance; the age of
 20 12 the defendant; the defendant's ability to appreciate the
 20 13 wrongfulness of the conduct due to mental disease but not
 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no
 20 15 significant prior criminal history; the defendant was under
 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.
 20 31    The death penalty sentence would be reviewed automatically
 20 32 by the supreme court.  The supreme court shall review the trial
 20 33 and judgment separately from the sentencing proceeding.   If the
 20 34 supreme court finds error in the sentencing proceeding, the

 20 14 to a degree to constitute a defense; the defendant has no

 20 16 extreme duress; the defendant did not directly commit the
 20 17 murder and sexual abuse; and the defendant's character or
 20 18 record or the circumstances of the offense.  The sentencing
 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or
 20 20 innocence by the same trier of fact.
 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have
 20 23 the jury hear the proceedings) is to weigh any aggravating
 20 24 circumstances established beyond a reasonable doubt by the
 20 25 state against any of the enumerated mitigating circumstances
 20 26 which may be presented by the defendant.  Evidence of certain
 20 27 juvenile delinquency adjudications is not admissible in any
 20 28 proceeding to determine the sentence.  If the jury fails to
 20 29 agree unanimously on the required affirmative findings, the
 20 30 penalty imposed would be life imprisonment.

 21  7 witnessing of executions.
 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
 21 13    An employee of the state shall not be required to perform or
 21 14 assist in any execution and shall not be discriminated against
 21 15 for refusing to participate.

 21 18 provisions unchanged in newly created Code section 902.1B in
 21 19 the bill. Juvenile felons are not subject to imposition of a
 21 20 sentence of death.

 20 19 proceeding is conducted separately from the finding of guilt or

 20 21    For the sentencing proceeding, the trier of fact (the jury
 20 22 or the court if the defendant has waived the right to have

 21  8    A person who is sentenced to death, but who is pregnant when
 21  9 the warrant of execution is issued, is not to be executed until
 21 10 the person is no longer pregnant.  A procedure is also provided
 21 11 to stay execution of a condemned inmate who becomes insane
 21 12 after conviction but before execution.
