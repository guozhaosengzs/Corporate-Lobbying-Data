  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill provides immunity from certain criminal offenses
  4  1 and prohibits certain disciplinary sanctions for certain
  4  2 persons who seek or require emergency assistance for alcohol or
  4  3 drug=related overdoses or protection from certain crimes.
  4  4    The bill creates new Code section 701.12, which provides
  4  5 that a person shall not be charged or prosecuted for public
  4  6 intoxication, possession of alcohol under the legal age,
  4  7 possession or use of a controlled substance, possession of
  4  8 drug paraphernalia, use of a driver's license by an underage
  4  9 person to obtain alcohol, or possession of an open container in
  4 10 a motor vehicle, if the person in good faith sought emergency
  4 11 assistance for the person or another person due to an alcohol
  4 12 or drug=related overdose or because the person or other
  4 13 person is a victim of a crime prohibited by Code chapter 708
  4 14 (assault), 709 (sexual abuse), or 710A (human trafficking).
  4 15 A person seeking emergency assistance is only eligible for
  4 16 immunity if the person, or persons acting in concert, is
  4 17 the first person to seek emergency assistance, provides the
  4 18 reporting person's name and contact information to medical
  4 19 or law enforcement personnel, remains on the scene until
  4 20 assistance arrives or is provided, and cooperates with medical
  4 21 and law enforcement personnel. The bill also provides immunity
  4 22 to the person for whom emergency assistance was sought.
  4 23    Under Code section 232.52, a juvenile court may suspend
  4 24 or revoke the driver's license or operating privilege of a
  4 25 person under the age of 18, for a period of one year, who
  4 26 has violated Code section 123.46 or 123.47 or Code chapter
  4 27 124. Because the bill provides immunity to persons from those
  4 28 provisions, a person under the age of 18 who receives immunity
  4 29 from prosecution under the bill will not face the loss of such
  4 30 person's driver's license for one year.
  4 31    The bill provides that if a person under the age of 18 is
  4 32 discovered consuming or to be in possession of alcohol but
  4 33 receives immunity from prosecution under Code section 701.12,
  4 34 a peace officer shall notify a juvenile court officer of
  4 35 such person's consumption or possession. Under Code section
  5  1 123.47B(2), the juvenile court officer is required to notify
  5  2 the person's custodial parent, legal guardian, or custodian and
  5  3 the superintendent of authority in charge of the school the
  5  4 person attends of the consumption or possession.
  5  5    The bill directs the board of regents to prohibit the regents
  5  6 universities from imposing certain disciplinary sanctions
  5  7 against a student for the possession or consumption of alcohol
  5  8 or a controlled substance or possession of drug paraphernalia
  5  9 if the student is immune from prosecution pursuant to new Code
  5 10 section 701.12. The prohibited disciplinary sanctions are the
  5 11 removal from a course, enrollment restrictions in a course
  5 12 or program, suspension or expulsion from the university, or
  5 13 eviction or exclusion from student housing.

  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill provides immunity from certain criminal offenses
  4  1 and prohibits certain disciplinary sanctions for certain
  4  2 persons who seek or require emergency assistance for alcohol or
  4  3 drug=related overdoses or protection from certain crimes.
  4  4    The bill creates new Code section 701.12, which provides
  4  5 that a person shall not be charged or prosecuted for public
  4  6 intoxication, possession of alcohol under the legal age,
  4  7 possession or use of a controlled substance, possession of
  4  8 drug paraphernalia, use of a driver's license by an underage
  4  9 person to obtain alcohol, or possession of an open container in
  4 10 a motor vehicle, if the person in good faith sought emergency
  4 11 assistance for the person or another person due to an alcohol
  4 12 or drug=related overdose or because the person or other
  4 13 person is a victim of a crime prohibited by Code chapter 708
  4 14 (assault), 709 (sexual abuse), or 710A (human trafficking).
  4 15 A person seeking emergency assistance is only eligible for
  4 16 immunity if the person, or persons acting in concert, is
  4 17 the first person to seek emergency assistance, provides the
  4 18 reporting person's name and contact information to medical
  4 19 or law enforcement personnel, remains on the scene until
  4 20 assistance arrives or is provided, and cooperates with medical
  4 21 and law enforcement personnel. The bill also provides immunity
  4 22 to the person for whom emergency assistance was sought.
  4 23    Under Code section 232.52, a juvenile court may suspend
  4 24 or revoke the driver's license or operating privilege of a
  4 25 person under the age of 18, for a period of one year, who
  4 26 has violated Code section 123.46 or 123.47 or Code chapter
  4 27 124. Because the bill provides immunity to persons from those
  4 28 provisions, a person under the age of 18 who receives immunity
  4 29 from prosecution under the bill will not face the loss of such
  4 30 person's driver's license for one year.
  4 31    The bill provides that if a person under the age of 18 is
  4 32 discovered consuming or to be in possession of alcohol but
  4 33 receives immunity from prosecution under Code section 701.12,
  4 34 a peace officer shall notify a juvenile court officer of
  4 35 such person's consumption or possession. Under Code section
  5  1 123.47B(2), the juvenile court officer is required to notify
  5  2 the person's custodial parent, legal guardian, or custodian and
  5  3 the superintendent of authority in charge of the school the
  5  4 person attends of the consumption or possession.
  5  5    The bill directs the board of regents to prohibit the regents
  5  6 universities from imposing certain disciplinary sanctions
  5  7 against a student for the possession or consumption of alcohol
  5  8 or a controlled substance or possession of drug paraphernalia
  5  9 if the student is immune from prosecution pursuant to new Code
  5 10 section 701.12. The prohibited disciplinary sanctions are the
  5 11 removal from a course, enrollment restrictions in a course
  5 12 or program, suspension or expulsion from the university, or
  5 13 eviction or exclusion from student housing.

  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill provides immunity from certain criminal offenses
  4  1 and prohibits certain disciplinary sanctions for certain
  4  2 persons who seek or require emergency assistance for alcohol or
  4  3 drug=related overdoses or protection from certain crimes.
  4  4    The bill creates new Code section 701.12, which provides
  4  5 that a person shall not be charged or prosecuted for public
  4  6 intoxication, possession of alcohol under the legal age,
  4  7 possession or use of a controlled substance, possession of
  4  8 drug paraphernalia, use of a driver's license by an underage
  4  9 person to obtain alcohol, or possession of an open container in
  4 10 a motor vehicle, if the person in good faith sought emergency
  4 11 assistance for the person or another person due to an alcohol
  4 12 or drug=related overdose or because the person or other
  4 13 person is a victim of a crime prohibited by Code chapter 708
  4 14 (assault), 709 (sexual abuse), or 710A (human trafficking).
  4 15 A person seeking emergency assistance is only eligible for
  4 16 immunity if the person, or persons acting in concert, is
  4 17 the first person to seek emergency assistance, provides the
  4 18 reporting person's name and contact information to medical
  4 19 or law enforcement personnel, remains on the scene until
  4 20 assistance arrives or is provided, and cooperates with medical
  4 21 and law enforcement personnel. The bill also provides immunity
  4 22 to the person for whom emergency assistance was sought.
  4 23    Under Code section 232.52, a juvenile court may suspend
  4 24 or revoke the driver's license or operating privilege of a
  4 25 person under the age of 18, for a period of one year, who
  4 26 has violated Code section 123.46 or 123.47 or Code chapter
  4 27 124. Because the bill provides immunity to persons from those
  4 28 provisions, a person under the age of 18 who receives immunity
  4 29 from prosecution under the bill will not face the loss of such
  4 30 person's driver's license for one year.
  4 31    The bill provides that if a person under the age of 18 is
  4 32 discovered consuming or to be in possession of alcohol but
  4 33 receives immunity from prosecution under Code section 701.12,
  4 34 a peace officer shall notify a juvenile court officer of
  4 35 such person's consumption or possession. Under Code section
  5  1 123.47B(2), the juvenile court officer is required to notify
  5  2 the person's custodial parent, legal guardian, or custodian and
  5  3 the superintendent of authority in charge of the school the
  5  4 person attends of the consumption or possession.
  5  5    The bill directs the board of regents to prohibit the regents
  5  6 universities from imposing certain disciplinary sanctions
  5  7 against a student for the possession or consumption of alcohol
  5  8 or a controlled substance or possession of drug paraphernalia
  5  9 if the student is immune from prosecution pursuant to new Code
  5 10 section 701.12. The prohibited disciplinary sanctions are the
  5 11 removal from a course, enrollment restrictions in a course
  5 12 or program, suspension or expulsion from the university, or
  5 13 eviction or exclusion from student housing.

  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill provides immunity from certain criminal offenses
  4  1 and prohibits certain disciplinary sanctions for certain
  4  2 persons who seek or require emergency assistance for alcohol or
  4  3 drug=related overdoses or protection from certain crimes.
  4  4    The bill creates new Code section 701.12, which provides
  4  5 that a person shall not be charged or prosecuted for public
  4  6 intoxication, possession of alcohol under the legal age,
  4  7 possession or use of a controlled substance, possession of
  4  8 drug paraphernalia, use of a driver's license by an underage
  4  9 person to obtain alcohol, or possession of an open container in
  4 10 a motor vehicle, if the person in good faith sought emergency
  4 11 assistance for the person or another person due to an alcohol
  4 12 or drug=related overdose or because the person or other
  4 13 person is a victim of a crime prohibited by Code chapter 708
  4 14 (assault), 709 (sexual abuse), or 710A (human trafficking).
  4 15 A person seeking emergency assistance is only eligible for

  4 28 provisions, a person under the age of 18 who receives immunity
  4 29 from prosecution under the bill will not face the loss of such
  4 30 person's driver's license for one year.
  4 31    The bill provides that if a person under the age of 18 is

  4 33 receives immunity from prosecution under Code section 701.12,
  4 34 a peace officer shall notify a juvenile court officer of
  4 35 such person's consumption or possession. Under Code section
  5  1 123.47B(2), the juvenile court officer is required to notify
  5  2 the person's custodial parent, legal guardian, or custodian and
  5  3 the superintendent of authority in charge of the school the
  5  4 person attends of the consumption or possession.
  5  5    The bill directs the board of regents to prohibit the regents
  5  6 universities from imposing certain disciplinary sanctions

  4  2 persons who seek or require emergency assistance for alcohol or
  4  3 drug=related overdoses or protection from certain crimes.
  4  4    The bill creates new Code section 701.12, which provides
  4  5 that a person shall not be charged or prosecuted for public
  4  6 intoxication, possession of alcohol under the legal age,
  4  7 possession or use of a controlled substance, possession of
  4  8 drug paraphernalia, use of a driver's license by an underage
  4  9 person to obtain alcohol, or possession of an open container in
  4 10 a motor vehicle, if the person in good faith sought emergency
  4 11 assistance for the person or another person due to an alcohol
  4 12 or drug=related overdose or because the person or other
  4 13 person is a victim of a crime prohibited by Code chapter 708
  4 14 (assault), 709 (sexual abuse), or 710A (human trafficking).
  4 15 A person seeking emergency assistance is only eligible for
  4 16 immunity if the person, or persons acting in concert, is
  4 17 the first person to seek emergency assistance, provides the
  4 18 reporting person's name and contact information to medical
  4 19 or law enforcement personnel, remains on the scene until
  4 20 assistance arrives or is provided, and cooperates with medical
  4 21 and law enforcement personnel. The bill also provides immunity
  4 22 to the person for whom emergency assistance was sought.
  4 23    Under Code section 232.52, a juvenile court may suspend
  4 24 or revoke the driver's license or operating privilege of a
  4 25 person under the age of 18, for a period of one year, who
  4 26 has violated Code section 123.46 or 123.47 or Code chapter
  4 27 124. Because the bill provides immunity to persons from those
  4 28 provisions, a person under the age of 18 who receives immunity
  4 29 from prosecution under the bill will not face the loss of such
  4 30 person's driver's license for one year.
  4 31    The bill provides that if a person under the age of 18 is
  4 32 discovered consuming or to be in possession of alcohol but
  4 33 receives immunity from prosecution under Code section 701.12,
  4 34 a peace officer shall notify a juvenile court officer of
  4 35 such person's consumption or possession. Under Code section
  5  1 123.47B(2), the juvenile court officer is required to notify
  5  2 the person's custodial parent, legal guardian, or custodian and
  5  3 the superintendent of authority in charge of the school the
  5  4 person attends of the consumption or possession.
  5  5    The bill directs the board of regents to prohibit the regents
  5  6 universities from imposing certain disciplinary sanctions
  5  7 against a student for the possession or consumption of alcohol
  5  8 or a controlled substance or possession of drug paraphernalia
  5  9 if the student is immune from prosecution pursuant to new Code
  5 10 section 701.12. The prohibited disciplinary sanctions are the

  5 12 or program, suspension or expulsion from the university, or
