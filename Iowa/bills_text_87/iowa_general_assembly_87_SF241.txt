  3 27    This bill relates to law enforcement officers including the
  3 28 establishment of a law enforcement officer privilege and the
  3 29 confidentiality of certain law enforcement officer personnel
  3 30 records.
  3 31    The bill defines a "law enforcement officer" to mean the same
  3 32 as peace officer as defined in Code section 801.4.
  3 33    Under the bill, a law enforcement officer shall not be
  3 34 examined or be required to give evidence in any criminal
  3 35 proceeding that requires the disclosure of any records or
  4  1 information relating to any of the following: techniques
  4  2 and procedures used by law enforcement officers to lawfully
  4  3 observe, hear, or monitor information related to criminal
  4  4 activity, unless such techniques and procedures are disclosed
  4  5 in a public forum or are disclosed voluntarily by the law
  4  6 enforcement officer or the agency that employs the law
  4  7 enforcement officer; identification documents necessary to

  5  5    The bill defines "undercover law enforcement officer" to
  5  6 mean a law enforcement officer who is actively involved with
  5  7 and assigned to investigate alleged violations of state or
  5  8 federal law and whose identity as a law enforcement officer is
  5  9 concealed while conducting an investigation.
  5 10    The bill provides that the name, photograph, compensation
  5 11 and benefit records, time records, residential address, or any
  5 12 other personal identifying information of an undercover law
