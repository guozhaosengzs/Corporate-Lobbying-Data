EXPLANATION
1


The
inclusion
of
this
explanation
does
not
constitute
agreement
with
2


the
explanation’s
substance
by
the
members
of
the
general
assembly.
3


This
bill
relates
to
the
filing
requirements
for
claims
made
4


under
the
Iowa
tort
claims
Act.
5


Pursuant
to
the
Iowa
tort
claims
Act
(Code
chapter
669),
the
6


state
waives
its
sovereign
immunity
for
certain
tort
claims.
7


Prior
to
bringing
suit,
however,
a
claimant
must
exhaust
8


administrative
remedies
by
filing
a
claim
in
writing
with
the
9


director
of
the
department
of
management.
A
claimant
may
then
10


bring
suit
if
the
attorney
general
has
made
a
final
disposition
11


of
the
claim
or
if
the
attorney
general
has
not
made
a
final
12


disposition
of
the
claim
within
six
months
of
such
filing
and
13


the
claimant
withdraws
the
claim.
14


The
bill
provides
that
the
claimant
must
sign
and
verify
a
15


claim
filed
under
the
Iowa
tort
claims
Act.
16


The
bill
is
in
response
to
the
Iowa
supreme
court’s
decision
17


in
Segura
v.
State,
No.
15-0203
(Iowa
Jan.
13,
2017),
which
18


held
that
a
claimant’s
failure
to
sign
and
verify
a
claim
did
19


not
deprive
the
district
court
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
