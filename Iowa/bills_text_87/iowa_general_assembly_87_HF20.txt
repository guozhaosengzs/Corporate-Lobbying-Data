  2  9    This bill expands the Code provision that establishes
  2 10 the criminal offense of sexual exploitation by a school

  3  4    A person who commits sexual exploitation by a school
  3  5 employee in violation of Code section 709.15(3) commits either
  3  6 an aggravated misdemeanor, which is punishable by confinement
  3  7 for no more than two years and a fine of at least $625 but not

  3  9 by confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at

  3 12 in disciplinary action by the board of educational examiners
