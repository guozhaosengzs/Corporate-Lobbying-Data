  5  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5  8    GENERAL.  This bill amends provisions in Iowa's fence law
  5  9 (Code chapter 359A) that in part governs the construction
  5 10 (erection) or maintenance of fences existing on the property
  5 11 boundary between land of adjoining owners (sometimes referred
  5 12 to as partition fences), in either circumstances.  The first
  5 13 circumstance involves a controversy between the owners that
  5 14 results in an order being issued by the board of trustees
  5 15 of the township where the property boundary is located, who
  5 16 assume the title of fence viewers (Code sections 359A.3 through
  5 17 359A.11 and Code section 359A.22).  The second circumstance
  5 18 involves a private agreement entered into by the owners which
  5 19 is recorded in the county where the township is located (Code
  5 20 sections 359A.12 and 359A.13).
  5 21    BILL'S PROVISIONS == CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.  The bill
  5 22 provides for a fence viewer who has a conflict of interest
  5 23 involving any question related to the controversy: If the
  5 24 fence viewer may have a conflict of interest, the fence viewer
  5 25 must make disclosure of the possible conflict of interest to
  5 26 the parties and other fence viewers. If the fence viewer
  5 27 has an actual conflict of interest, the fence viewer must
  5 28 be disqualified either at the fence viewer's election or by
  5 29 vote of the other trustees. Either action must be described
  5 30 in the fence viewers' notice to the parties and order.  A
  5 31 conflict of interest occurs when a fence viewer is asked to
  5 32 make a determination that would directly affect the personal
  5 33 or financial interests of the fence viewer or immediate family
  5 34 member.  If the trustee is disqualified, the county's board
  5 35 of supervisors must appoint a substitute (unless the township
  6  1 clerk selects a fence viewer in cases in which the adjoining
  6  2 property is located in more than one township).  The board
  6  3 of supervisors may also adopt an ordinance providing for
  6  4 additional circumstances which create a conflict of interest
  6  5 and procedures for the disqualification or replacement of a
  6  6 fence viewer. The bill provides that the fence viewer may
  6  7 participate in the matter if the parties to the controversy are
  6  8 notified of the conflict and sign a waiver.
  6  9    BILL'S PROVISIONS == ERECTION OF FENCES BASED ON A
  6 10 DETERMINATION OF UNFEASIBILITY.  The bill provides that the
  6 11 fence viewers may determine that the erection of a fence on
  6 12 the  property boundary between the adjoining properties is
  6 13 unfeasible pursuant to a site evaluation conducted by the fence
  6 14 viewers.  The determination may be based on a characteristic
  6 15 of the land (e.g., land slope), the presence of water (e.g.,
  6 16 located in a floodplain), some prior right (e.g., an easement),
  6 17 or a suitable area is unavailable.  In that case, the trustees
  6 18 must assist the parties in reaching an agreement or if that
  6 19 fails take account of the land's characteristics in the order.
  6 20 The order shall require the fence be erected at a feasible
  6 21 location that is closest to the adjoining party's property
  6 22 boundary.
  6 23    BACKGROUND.  The owner of property has a right to erect a
  6 24 fence on the property boundary between the owner's property
  6 25 and an adjacent owner (Code section 359A.16).  A controversy
  6 26 requiring participation by a township's fence viewers
  6 27 may be triggered by an owner demanding that the adjoining
  6 28 owner or adjoining owners share in the costs of erecting,
  6 29 maintaining, or repairing the fence.  The fence viewers must
  6 30 provide notice to each adjacent owner that they are parties
  6 31 to the controversy.  The fence viewers act as adjudicators,
  6 32 by determining the obligations, rights, and duties of the
  6 33 respective parties, including contributions (payments) which
  6 34 must be set forth in an order and be assessed and collected as
  6 35 ordinary taxes (Code section 359A.6).  The order is subject
  7  1 to appeal in district court (Code sections 359A.23 through
  7  2 359A.25).

  6 12 the  property boundary between the adjoining properties is
  6 13 unfeasible pursuant to a site evaluation conducted by the fence
  6 14 viewers.  The determination may be based on a characteristic
  6 15 of the land (e.g., land slope), the presence of water (e.g.,
  6 16 located in a floodplain), some prior right (e.g., an easement),
  6 17 or a suitable area is unavailable.  In that case, the trustees
  6 18 must assist the parties in reaching an agreement or if that
  6 19 fails take account of the land's characteristics in the order.
  6 20 The order shall require the fence be erected at a feasible
  6 21 location that is closest to the adjoining party's property
  6 22 boundary.

  6 24 fence on the property boundary between the owner's property
  6 25 and an adjacent owner (Code section 359A.16).  A controversy
  6 26 requiring participation by a township's fence viewers
  6 27 may be triggered by an owner demanding that the adjoining
  6 28 owner or adjoining owners share in the costs of erecting,
  6 29 maintaining, or repairing the fence.  The fence viewers must
  6 30 provide notice to each adjacent owner that they are parties
  6 31 to the controversy.  The fence viewers act as adjudicators,
  6 32 by determining the obligations, rights, and duties of the
  6 33 respective parties, including contributions (payments) which
  6 34 must be set forth in an order and be assessed and collected as
  6 35 ordinary taxes (Code section 359A.6).  The order is subject

  6 11 fence viewers may determine that the erection of a fence on
  6 12 the  property boundary between the adjoining properties is
  6 13 unfeasible pursuant to a site evaluation conducted by the fence

  6 17 or a suitable area is unavailable.  In that case, the trustees
