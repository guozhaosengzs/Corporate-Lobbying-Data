 21  4                           EXPLANATION
 21  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  7    GENERAL.  This bill amends a number of Code provisions
 21  8 administered and enforced by the department of agriculture
 21  9 and land stewardship (department), relating to forest and
 21 10 fruit tree reservations; soil conservation and water quality;
 21 11 agricultural animal health; licenses and associated fees; the
 21 12 manufacture of fertilizers and soil conditioners; the control
 21 13 of noxious weed seeds; the delivery of commodities in bulk; and
 21 14 decals affixed to motor fuel pumps notifying the public of high
 21 15 percentage ethanol blends in gasoline.
 21 16    FOREST AND FRUIT TREE RESERVATIONS.  The bill eliminates a
 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  7    GENERAL.  This bill amends a number of Code provisions
 21  8 administered and enforced by the department of agriculture
 21  9 and land stewardship (department), relating to forest and
 21 10 fruit tree reservations; soil conservation and water quality;
 21 11 agricultural animal health; licenses and associated fees; the
 21 12 manufacture of fertilizers and soil conditioners; the control
 21 13 of noxious weed seeds; the delivery of commodities in bulk; and
 21 14 decals affixed to motor fuel pumps notifying the public of high
 21 15 percentage ethanol blends in gasoline.
 21 16    FOREST AND FRUIT TREE RESERVATIONS.  The bill eliminates a
 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  7    GENERAL.  This bill amends a number of Code provisions
 21  8 administered and enforced by the department of agriculture
 21  9 and land stewardship (department), relating to forest and
 21 10 fruit tree reservations; soil conservation and water quality;
 21 11 agricultural animal health; licenses and associated fees; the
 21 12 manufacture of fertilizers and soil conditioners; the control
 21 13 of noxious weed seeds; the delivery of commodities in bulk; and
 21 14 decals affixed to motor fuel pumps notifying the public of high
 21 15 percentage ethanol blends in gasoline.
 21 16    FOREST AND FRUIT TREE RESERVATIONS.  The bill eliminates a
 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21  4                           EXPLANATION
 21  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  7    GENERAL.  This bill amends a number of Code provisions
 21  8 administered and enforced by the department of agriculture
 21  9 and land stewardship (department), relating to forest and
 21 10 fruit tree reservations; soil conservation and water quality;
 21 11 agricultural animal health; licenses and associated fees; the
 21 12 manufacture of fertilizers and soil conditioners; the control
 21 13 of noxious weed seeds; the delivery of commodities in bulk; and
 21 14 decals affixed to motor fuel pumps notifying the public of high
 21 15 percentage ethanol blends in gasoline.
 21 16    FOREST AND FRUIT TREE RESERVATIONS.  The bill eliminates a
 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21  7    GENERAL.  This bill amends a number of Code provisions
 21  8 administered and enforced by the department of agriculture
 21  9 and land stewardship (department), relating to forest and
 21 10 fruit tree reservations; soil conservation and water quality;
 21 11 agricultural animal health; licenses and associated fees; the
 21 12 manufacture of fertilizers and soil conditioners; the control
 21 13 of noxious weed seeds; the delivery of commodities in bulk; and
 21 14 decals affixed to motor fuel pumps notifying the public of high
 21 15 percentage ethanol blends in gasoline.
 21 16    FOREST AND FRUIT TREE RESERVATIONS.  The bill eliminates a
 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21  3 section 200.4 takes effect June 1, 2018.
 21  4                           EXPLANATION
 21  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  7    GENERAL.  This bill amends a number of Code provisions
 21  8 administered and enforced by the department of agriculture
 21  9 and land stewardship (department), relating to forest and
 21 10 fruit tree reservations; soil conservation and water quality;
 21 11 agricultural animal health; licenses and associated fees; the
 21 12 manufacture of fertilizers and soil conditioners; the control
 21 13 of noxious weed seeds; the delivery of commodities in bulk; and
 21 14 decals affixed to motor fuel pumps notifying the public of high
 21 15 percentage ethanol blends in gasoline.
 21 16    FOREST AND FRUIT TREE RESERVATIONS.  The bill eliminates a
 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21  4                           EXPLANATION
 21  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  7    GENERAL.  This bill amends a number of Code provisions
 21  8 administered and enforced by the department of agriculture
 21  9 and land stewardship (department), relating to forest and
 21 10 fruit tree reservations; soil conservation and water quality;
 21 11 agricultural animal health; licenses and associated fees; the
 21 12 manufacture of fertilizers and soil conditioners; the control
 21 13 of noxious weed seeds; the delivery of commodities in bulk; and
 21 14 decals affixed to motor fuel pumps notifying the public of high
 21 15 percentage ethanol blends in gasoline.
 21 16    FOREST AND FRUIT TREE RESERVATIONS.  The bill eliminates a
 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 14 decals affixed to motor fuel pumps notifying the public of high
 21 15 percentage ethanol blends in gasoline.
 21 16    FOREST AND FRUIT TREE RESERVATIONS.  The bill eliminates a
 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the

 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a

 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue

 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is

 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of

 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil

 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21  5 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 21  6 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 21  7    GENERAL.  This bill amends a number of Code provisions
 21  8 administered and enforced by the department of agriculture
 21  9 and land stewardship (department), relating to forest and
 21 10 fruit tree reservations; soil conservation and water quality;
 21 11 agricultural animal health; licenses and associated fees; the
 21 12 manufacture of fertilizers and soil conditioners; the control
 21 13 of noxious weed seeds; the delivery of commodities in bulk; and
 21 14 decals affixed to motor fuel pumps notifying the public of high
 21 15 percentage ethanol blends in gasoline.
 21 16    FOREST AND FRUIT TREE RESERVATIONS.  The bill eliminates a
 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 14 decals affixed to motor fuel pumps notifying the public of high
 21 15 percentage ethanol blends in gasoline.
 21 16    FOREST AND FRUIT TREE RESERVATIONS.  The bill eliminates a
 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an

 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil

 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section

 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill

 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code

 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are

 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

       da/rj
 21  7    GENERAL.  This bill amends a number of Code provisions
 21  8 administered and enforced by the department of agriculture
 21  9 and land stewardship (department), relating to forest and
 21 10 fruit tree reservations; soil conservation and water quality;
 21 11 agricultural animal health; licenses and associated fees; the
 21 12 manufacture of fertilizers and soil conditioners; the control
 21 13 of noxious weed seeds; the delivery of commodities in bulk; and
 21 14 decals affixed to motor fuel pumps notifying the public of high
 21 15 percentage ethanol blends in gasoline.
 21 16    FOREST AND FRUIT TREE RESERVATIONS.  The bill eliminates a
 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect

 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture

 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 13 of noxious weed seeds; the delivery of commodities in bulk; and
 21 14 decals affixed to motor fuel pumps notifying the public of high
 21 15 percentage ethanol blends in gasoline.
 21 16    FOREST AND FRUIT TREE RESERVATIONS.  The bill eliminates a
 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect

 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 15 percentage ethanol blends in gasoline.
 21 16    FOREST AND FRUIT TREE RESERVATIONS.  The bill eliminates a
 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.

 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 15 percentage ethanol blends in gasoline.
 21 16    FOREST AND FRUIT TREE RESERVATIONS.  The bill eliminates a
 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections

 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL

 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine

 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 16    FOREST AND FRUIT TREE RESERVATIONS.  The bill eliminates a
 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier

 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR

 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The

 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 17 provision requiring the department to enforce laws regarding
 21 18 forest and fruit tree reservations (Code section 159.6). A
 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a

 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates

 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 19 person who currently holds title to a qualifying reservation
 21 20 may be exempt from property taxes upon completing an
 21 21 application according to criteria established by the natural
 21 22 resource commission which must be filed with the county auditor
 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated

 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier

 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant

 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The

 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor

 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight

 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 23 where the reservation is located (Code chapter 427C).
 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is

 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 24    STATE SOIL CONSERVATION AND WATER QUALITY COMMITTEE ==
 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018

 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 25 NAME CHANGE.  The bill changes the name of the state soil
 21 26 conservation committee to the state soil conservation and water
 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant

 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee

 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL

 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the

 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine

 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 27 quality committee (committee) wherever it appears in the Code.
 21 28 The committee cooperates with the department's division of soil
 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect

 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018

 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1

 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 29 conservation and water quality (division) and with local soil
 21 30 and water conservation districts (districts) to assist persons
 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect

 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture

 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the

 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat

 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section

 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's

 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for

 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 31 in establishing and maintaining a number of soil conservation
 21 32 and erosion control practices on agricultural land which are
 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.

 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 33 often financed on a cost=share basis (Code chapter 161A).
 21 34    MANAGEMENT PRACTICES == SPECIFIC MEASURES.  The bill
 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the

 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the

 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31

 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section

 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to

 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR

 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a

 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 21 35 authorizes the division to finance edge=of=field practices at
 22  1 a cost=share rate established by the division (Code section
 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect

 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018

 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the

 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling

 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).

 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section

 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65

 22  2 161A.73). The bill authorizes the division to finance the
 22  3 establishment of cover crops as an eligible management practice
 22  4 qualifying for state financing (Code section 161A.73).  The
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018

 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).
       LSB 1331HV (1) 87
       da/rj
 22  5 bill eliminates a provision allowing fall plowing of so=called
 22  6 gumbo soil as part of is regulations establishing soil loss
 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and

 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee

 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight

 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);

 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).

 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 22  7 limits (Code section 161A.44).
 22  8    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == HEALTH.  The bill eliminates a
 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required

 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee

 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair

 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65

 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates

 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's

 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR

 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant

 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 22  9 provision that allows an ear notch or tattoo to be used to
 22 10 individually identify registered swine required to be moved
 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the

 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would

 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section

 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's

 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for

 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A

 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must

 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 22 11 for exhibition or breeding under a certificate of veterinary
 22 12 inspection.  The swine would still have to be identified in
 22 13 a manner required by the department (Code section 163.30).
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also

 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must

 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect

 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018

 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are

 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);

 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee

 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).
       LSB 1331HV (1) 87
       da/rj
 22 14 The bill provides that 12 rather than 10 months old is the
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

       da/rj
 22 15 highest age limit that a native female bovine animal may be
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).
       LSB 1331HV (1) 87
       da/rj
 22 16 vaccinated for brucellosis (Code section 164.3).  The bill also
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).
       LSB 1331HV (1) 87
       da/rj
 22 17 eliminates a requirement that in order for the department to
 22 18 dispose of classical=swine=fever vaccine or serum, the United
 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture

 22 19 States department of agriculture must declare the state as free
 22 20 of the disease (Code section 166.42). A person violating a
 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to

 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a

 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR

 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision

 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).

 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes

 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would

 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of

 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the

 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 22 21 requirement in Code chapter 164 governing the control of bovine
 22 22 brucellosis is guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section
 22 23 164.31).
 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 22 24    AGRICULTURAL ANIMALS == SLAUGHTER PRACTICES.  The bill
 22 25 provides that a state meat processing establishment must use
 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code

 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the

 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for

 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR

 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections

 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL

 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section

 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair

 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 22 26 humane practices when slaughtering caprine species.  Currently,
 22 27 such practices must be used when slaughtering bovine, porcine,
 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer

 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is

 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the

 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 22 28 or ovine species or animals classified as farm deer (Code
 22 29 section 189A.18).  Generally, a person who violates a provision
 22 30 in Code chapter 189A regulating slaughtering practices is
 22 31 guilty of a simple misdemeanor (Code section 189A.17).
 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect

 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018

 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the

 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an

 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated

 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's

 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a

 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR

 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision

 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 22 32    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == LICENSE CYCLE AND RATES.
 22 33  The bill provides that a number of licenses issued by the
 22 34 department would expire on a two=year rather than one=year
 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR

 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections

 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL

 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is

 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 22 35 cycle and the corresponding combined first and second year
 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is

 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the

 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined

 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the

 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.

 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 23  1 fees would be payable to the department for deposit in the
 23  2 state treasury.  Currently, all licenses are due annually on
 23  3 a fixed date set by statute (expiration=anniversary date) so
 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine

 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 23  4 that a person obtaining an initial license on any day (issue
 23  5 date) must reobtain a new license or renew an existing license
 23  6 12 or fewer months later (ensuring that all such licenses are
 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee

 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine

 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 23  7 reissued or renewed on a single date).  The amount of the fee
 23  8 is either a fixed rate (flat fee) or a graduated rate which is
 23  9 connected to specific circumstances such as the size of the
 23 10 licensee's market (sliding scale fee).
 23 11    The bill provides that licenses with an
 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on

 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a

 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 23 12 expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1 of the
 23 13 second year, and who would pay a combined flat fee, includes
 23 14 a swine dealer or the dealer's agent (Code section 163.30);
 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect

 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which

 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 23 15 a lessor of breeding bulls (Code section 163.41); a sheep
 23 16 dealer (Code section 166A.2); a custom hatchery or chick
 23 17 dealer (Code section 168.3); and a manufacturer or distributor
 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.

 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the

 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 23 18 of commercial animal feed (Code section 198.4).  A licensee
 23 19 manufacturing or distributing fertilizer or a soil conditioner
 23 20 with an expiration=anniversary date which would fall on July 1
 23 21 of the second year would pay a fee based on the number of the
 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.

 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018

 23 22 licensee's business locations (Code section 200.4).  A licensee
 23 23 whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on December 31
 23 24 of the second year would include a mining operator whose flat
 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a

 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 23 25 fee for an initial license would remain the same but who would
 23 26 be required to pay a combined flat fee for a two=year renewal
 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to

 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR

 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The

 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a

 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code

 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain

 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor

 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the

 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine

 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors

 23 27 (Code section 208.7).  The expiration=anniversary date of a
 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR

 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 23 28 poultry dealer's licensee would be March 1 of the second year
 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 23 29 (Code section 197.2).  Generally, the amount of the combined
 23 30 fees for each of these described licenses would equal $20 or
 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant

 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a

 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a

 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).

 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.

 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors

 23 31 less.  A  dealer or broker purchasing livestock for slaughter
 23 32 and whose expiration=anniversary date would fall on June 30 of
 23 33 the second year would pay a combined flat fee of $100 and the
 23 34 agent of a dealer or broker would pay a combined flat fee of
 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.

 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section

 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to

 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR
 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant

 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who

 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a

 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain

 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section

 24 35 SOIL CONDITIONERS.  The bill amends the "Iowa Fertilizer
 25  1 Law" (Code chapter 200) which provides for the regulation of
 25  2 products referred to as fertilizer, fertilizer material, or
 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).

 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple
 25 24 misdemeanor (Code section 199.13).
 25 25    DELIVERY OF COMMODITIES IN BULK == USE DELIVERY TICKETS.  The
 25 26 bill amends two provisions that require the use of duplicative
 25 27 delivery tickets (tickets) by persons delivering bulk
 25 28 commodities such as grain but excluding liquids such as motor
 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections
 25 31 212.2 and 212.3).  The bill requires the ticket include the
 25 32 delivery date and type of commodity being delivered and allows
 25 33 for the vendor's ticket to be retained electronically.
 25 34    MOTOR FUEL PUMPS == HIGH ETHANOL BLENDED GASOLINE == LABEL
 25 35 REQUIREMENT.  The bill amends a provision requiring that a
 26  1 motor fuel pump dispensing ethanol blended gasoline with an
 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven
 26 14 days after the recorder has malfunctioned as long as a repair
 26 15 has been immediately initiated and during that period the user
 26 16 dates, signs, and accurately handwrites information on the
 26 17 ticket.
 26 18    CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  A simple misdemeanor is punishable by
 26 19 confinement for no more than 30 days or a fine of at least $65
 26 20 but not more than $625 or by both.  A serious misdemeanor is
 26 21 punishable by confinement for no more than one year and a fine
 26 22 of at least $315 but not more than $1,875.
 26 23    EFFECTIVE DATES.  Several provisions of the bill take effect
 26 24 June 1, 2017, including provisions regulating the licensing
 26 25 of swine dealers (Code sections 163.30 and 163.41), sheep
 26 26 dealers (Code section 166A.2), custom hatcheries and chick
 26 27 dealers (Code section 168.3) and manufacturers and distributors
 26 28 of commercial feed (Code section 198.4).  A provision which
 26 29 regulates the licensing of persons involved in the manufacture
 26 30 of fertilizers and soil conditioners takes effect June 1, 2018
 26 31 (Code section 200.4).

 23 35 $20 (Code section 172A.2).  In the case of an egg handler, the
 24  1 license's two=year expiration=anniversary date is calculated
 24  2 from the issue date.  The sliding scale fee remains based on
 24  3 the purchase or handling of cases of 30 dozen eggs and the
 24  4 combined fee would range from $40.40 to $675 (Code section
 24  5 196.3).
 24  6    LICENSES AND ASSOCIATED FEES == PESTICIDE DEALERS.  The bill
 24  7 does not change the December 31 expiration=anniversary date
 24  8 for a pesticide dealer's license or the June 30 date when a
 24  9 license fee is due (Code section 206.8).  The bill eliminates
 24 10 an option that allowed a dealer having less than $100,000 in
 24 11 gross retail pesticide sales (sales) in the previous year to
 24 12 pay an amount equal to one=tenth of 1 percent of the dealer's
 24 13 sales in the previous year.  The dealer would be required to
 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than
 24 20 $25,000.  The highest scheduled fee is $100 for persons having
 24 21 annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than $100,000. A
 24 22 dealer having $100,000 or more in gross sales must continue to
 24 23 use the one=tenth of 1 percent formula to calculate the amount
 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.
 24 34    APPLICATION OF FERTILIZERS, FERTILIZER MATERIALS, OR

 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are
 25 21 prohibited from being sold or transported in this state (Code
 25 22 sections 199.1 and 199.8).  A person violating a provision
 25 23 in the Code chapter regulating seed is guilty of a simple

 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section
 26 10 214A.11).
 26 11    The bill provides that a scale equipped with a weight
 26 12 recorder used to print or stamp the weight values on scale
 26 13 tickets (Code section 215.9) may remain operational for seven

 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be

 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who

 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor
 26  8 fuel is guilty of a serious misdemeanor or alternatively may
 26  9 be subject to a civil penalty of up to $1,000 (Code section

 24 14 calculate the fee according to the existing statutory schedule
 24 15 which assigns a specific fee amount to a corresponding tier
 24 16 of sales.  The bill creates a new scheduled fee of $10 for
 24 17 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less
 24 18 than $10,000.  Currently, the lowest scheduled fee is $25 for
 24 19 persons having annual gross retail pesticide sales of less than

 24 24 of the license fee.
 24 25    The bill retains a three=month grace period granted to both
 24 26 types of licensees so long as they pay a late fee.  For a dealer
 24 27 having less than $100,000 in sales, the bill requires a flat
 24 28 fee of $25 instead of the current sliding scale fee equaling
 24 29 $10 in October, $15 in November, and $25 after November.  For a
 24 30 dealer having $100,000 or more in sales, the bill requires a
 24 31 flat fee of 5 percent of the license fee instead of the current
 24 32 sliding scale fee equaling 2 percent in October, four percent
 24 33 in November, and 5 percent after November.

 25  3 soil conditioner used to promote plant growth, alter plant
 25  4 composition, produce increased crop yields, or correct soil
 25  5 acidity (Code section 200.3).  A person seeking to sell a
 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department
 25 15 to assess a $500 civil penalty for a violation of that Code
 25 16 chapter (Code section 200A.13). Generally, a person who
 25 17 violates a provision in either Code chapter is guilty of a
 25 18 simple misdemeanor (Code sections 200.18 and 200A.13).
 25 19    NOXIOUS WEED SEEDS.  The bill adds the plant seed palmer
 25 20 amaranth to the list of primary noxious weed seeds that are

 25 29 fuel.  Currently, one ticket must be delivered to the vendee
 25 30 and the other must be returned to the vendor (Code sections

 26  2 ethanol content higher than 15 percent be affixed with a decal
 26  3 stating that the motor fuel is only to be used in flexible
 26  4 fuel vehicles.  The bill provides that the decal must contain
 26  5 language specifying that the high ethanol blended gasoline is
 26  6 for use in such vehicles (Code section 214A.16).  A person
 26  7 who violates a provision of the Code chapter regulating motor

 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
 25 12 bill also amends the "Bulk Dry Animal Nutrient Products Law"
 25 13 (Code chapter 200A) regulating the sale of nutrients such as
 25 14 manure which are not labeled by authorizing the department

 25  6 fertilizer or soil conditioner on a commercial basis must
 25  7 register the product with the department and may be required
 25  8 to submit satisfactory evidence of its favorable effects and
 25  9 safety.  The bill requires that minimum requirements are to be
 25 10 established by efficacy testing or the substantiation of data
 25 11 relevant to Iowa crops and soils (Code section 200.5).  The
