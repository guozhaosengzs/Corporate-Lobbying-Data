  3  9                           EXPLANATION
  3 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill relates to the state school foundation program, by
  3 13 modifying requirements for the enactment of the state percents
  3 14 of growth, establishing state percents of growth, and modifying
  3 15 provisions relating to school district property tax replacement
  3 16 payments.
  3 17    The bill establishes a state percent of growth of 1.11
  3 18 percent for the budget year beginning July 1, 2017.  The
  3 19 state percent of growth is used to calculate the amount
  3 20 of supplemental state aid for a budget year as part of the
  3 21 state school foundation program.  The bill also establishes
  3 22 a categorical state percent of growth of 1.11 percent for
  3 23 the budget year beginning July 1, 2017. The categorical
  3 24 state percent of growth is used to calculate the amount of
  3 25 supplemental state aid for each of the categorical funding
  3 26 supplements.
  3 27    Current Code section 257.8 requires bills establishing the
  3 28 state percent of growth and the categorical state percent of
  3 29 growth to be enacted within 30 days of the submission in the
  3 30 year preceding the base year of the governor's budget. Code
  3 31 section 257.8 also requires the state percent of growth and the
  3 32 categorical state percent of growth to be enacted in separate
  3 33 bills and be the only subject matter of each bill. The bill
  3 34 strikes the subject matter requirement for such bills and
  3 35 specifies that the enactment deadline for bills establishing
  4  1 the state percent of growth and the categorical state percent
  4  2 of growth is within 30 days of transmission of the governor's
  4  3 budget, which Code section 8.21 requires by February 1 of the
  4  4 regular legislative session beginning in the base year.
  4  5    Current Code section 257.16B provides for school district
  4  6 property tax replacement payments. For each budget year
  4  7 beginning on or after July 1, 2016, each school district's
  4  8 property tax replacement payment amount is equal to the school
  4  9 district's weighted enrollment for the budget year multiplied
  4 10 by the difference of the following: (1) the regular program
  4 11 state cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July 1,
  4 12 2016, multiplied by 100 percent less the regular program
  4 13 foundation base per pupil percentage; and (2) the regular
  4 14 program state cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July
  4 15 1, 2012, multiplied by 100 percent less the regular program
  4 16 foundation base per pupil percentage. Under current law, the
  4 17 regular program foundation base per pupil percentage is 87.5
  4 18 percent.
  4 19    The bill modifies the replacement payment calculation for
  4 20 budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017. For each
  4 21 budget year beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each school
  4 22 district's property tax replacement payment amount is equal to
  4 23 the school district's weighted enrollment for the budget year
  4 24 multiplied by the difference of the following: (1) the regular
  4 25 program state cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July
  4 26 1, 2017, multiplied by 100 percent less the regular program
  4 27 foundation base per pupil percentage; and (2) the regular
  4 28 program state cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July
  4 29 1, 2012, multiplied by 100 percent less the regular program
  4 30 foundation base per pupil percentage.
  4 31    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies to school
  4 32 budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017.

  2 28 pursuant to section 257.1.
  2 29    (2)  The regular program state cost per pupil for the budget

  3 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill relates to the state school foundation program, by
  3 13 modifying requirements for the enactment of the state percents
  3 14 of growth, establishing state percents of growth, and modifying
  3 15 provisions relating to school district property tax replacement
  3 16 payments.
  3 17    The bill establishes a state percent of growth of 1.11
  3 18 percent for the budget year beginning July 1, 2017.  The
  3 19 state percent of growth is used to calculate the amount
  3 20 of supplemental state aid for a budget year as part of the
  3 21 state school foundation program.  The bill also establishes
  3 22 a categorical state percent of growth of 1.11 percent for
  3 23 the budget year beginning July 1, 2017. The categorical
  3 24 state percent of growth is used to calculate the amount of
  3 25 supplemental state aid for each of the categorical funding
  3 26 supplements.
  3 27    Current Code section 257.8 requires bills establishing the
  3 28 state percent of growth and the categorical state percent of
  3 29 growth to be enacted within 30 days of the submission in the
  3 30 year preceding the base year of the governor's budget. Code
  3 31 section 257.8 also requires the state percent of growth and the
  3 32 categorical state percent of growth to be enacted in separate
  3 33 bills and be the only subject matter of each bill. The bill
  3 34 strikes the subject matter requirement for such bills and
  3 35 specifies that the enactment deadline for bills establishing
  4  1 the state percent of growth and the categorical state percent
  4  2 of growth is within 30 days of transmission of the governor's
  4  3 budget, which Code section 8.21 requires by February 1 of the
  4  4 regular legislative session beginning in the base year.
  4  5    Current Code section 257.16B provides for school district
  4  6 property tax replacement payments. For each budget year
  4  7 beginning on or after July 1, 2016, each school district's
  4  8 property tax replacement payment amount is equal to the school
  4  9 district's weighted enrollment for the budget year multiplied
  4 10 by the difference of the following: (1) the regular program
  4 11 state cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July 1,
  4 12 2016, multiplied by 100 percent less the regular program
  4 13 foundation base per pupil percentage; and (2) the regular
  4 14 program state cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July
  4 15 1, 2012, multiplied by 100 percent less the regular program
  4 16 foundation base per pupil percentage. Under current law, the
  4 17 regular program foundation base per pupil percentage is 87.5
  4 18 percent.
  4 19    The bill modifies the replacement payment calculation for
  4 20 budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017. For each
  4 21 budget year beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each school
  4 22 district's property tax replacement payment amount is equal to
  4 23 the school district's weighted enrollment for the budget year
  4 24 multiplied by the difference of the following: (1) the regular
  4 25 program state cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July
  4 26 1, 2017, multiplied by 100 percent less the regular program
  4 27 foundation base per pupil percentage; and (2) the regular
  4 28 program state cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July
  4 29 1, 2012, multiplied by 100 percent less the regular program
  4 30 foundation base per pupil percentage.

  3 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 12    This bill relates to the state school foundation program, by
  3 13 modifying requirements for the enactment of the state percents
  3 14 of growth, establishing state percents of growth, and modifying
  3 15 provisions relating to school district property tax replacement
  3 16 payments.
  3 17    The bill establishes a state percent of growth of 1.11
  3 18 percent for the budget year beginning July 1, 2017.  The
  3 19 state percent of growth is used to calculate the amount
  3 20 of supplemental state aid for a budget year as part of the
  3 21 state school foundation program.  The bill also establishes
  3 22 a categorical state percent of growth of 1.11 percent for
  3 23 the budget year beginning July 1, 2017. The categorical
  3 24 state percent of growth is used to calculate the amount of
  3 25 supplemental state aid for each of the categorical funding
  3 26 supplements.
  3 27    Current Code section 257.8 requires bills establishing the
  3 28 state percent of growth and the categorical state percent of
  3 29 growth to be enacted within 30 days of the submission in the
  3 30 year preceding the base year of the governor's budget. Code
  3 31 section 257.8 also requires the state percent of growth and the
  3 32 categorical state percent of growth to be enacted in separate
  3 33 bills and be the only subject matter of each bill. The bill
  3 34 strikes the subject matter requirement for such bills and
  3 35 specifies that the enactment deadline for bills establishing
  4  1 the state percent of growth and the categorical state percent
  4  2 of growth is within 30 days of transmission of the governor's
  4  3 budget, which Code section 8.21 requires by February 1 of the
  4  4 regular legislative session beginning in the base year.
  4  5    Current Code section 257.16B provides for school district
  4  6 property tax replacement payments. For each budget year
  4  7 beginning on or after July 1, 2016, each school district's
  4  8 property tax replacement payment amount is equal to the school
  4  9 district's weighted enrollment for the budget year multiplied
  4 10 by the difference of the following: (1) the regular program
  4 11 state cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July 1,
  4 12 2016, multiplied by 100 percent less the regular program
  4 13 foundation base per pupil percentage; and (2) the regular
  4 14 program state cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July
  4 15 1, 2012, multiplied by 100 percent less the regular program
  4 16 foundation base per pupil percentage. Under current law, the
  4 17 regular program foundation base per pupil percentage is 87.5
  4 18 percent.
  4 19    The bill modifies the replacement payment calculation for
  4 20 budget years beginning on or after July 1, 2017. For each
  4 21 budget year beginning on or after July 1, 2017, each school
  4 22 district's property tax replacement payment amount is equal to
  4 23 the school district's weighted enrollment for the budget year
  4 24 multiplied by the difference of the following: (1) the regular
  4 25 program state cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July
  4 26 1, 2017, multiplied by 100 percent less the regular program
  4 27 foundation base per pupil percentage; and (2) the regular
  4 28 program state cost per pupil for the budget year beginning July
