  6  5                           EXPLANATION
  6  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  8    GENERAL.  This bill authorizes the department of natural
  6  9 resources to cede some of its authority to administer certain
  6 10 environmental statutes and its rules to a county board of
  6 11 supervisors upon the board's request.  A board that has been
  6 12 granted such authority conducts a county groundwater pollution
  6 13 control program according to the terms of a certificate of
  6 14 acceptance issued by the department.
  6 15    CERTIFICATE OF ACCEPTANCE == ISSUANCE.  A certificate of
  6 16 acceptance allows a county board of supervisors to administer
  6 17 and enforce state groundwater protection regulations that  apply
  6 18 to sources that are located in sensitive groundwater access
  6 19 areas (where there is karst terrain, or land where there is
  6 20 located an agricultural drainage well area, or known sinkhole).
  6 21 The regulations are limited to those in statute or rule under
  6 22 Code chapter 455B, division I and division III (providing
  6 23 general authority and water quality regulations); Code chapter
  6 24 459, subchapter III, and Code chapters 459, 459A, and 459B
  6 25 (providing for water quality regulation applicable to animal
  6 26 feeding operations); and Code chapter 460 (regulating sources
  6 27 that may contaminate groundwater from agricultural drainage
  6 28 wells).  The department may approve or disapprove a request
  6 29 but cannot limit or qualify the certificate of acceptance or
  6 30 reduce the scope of the certificate of acceptance so that it
  6 31 cedes less authority to conduct the program than requested by
  6 32 the board.  A county board of supervisors may adopt  ordinances,
  6 33 rules, or standards either consistent with or more strict than
  6 34 state law.
  6 35    CERTIFICATE OF ACCEPTANCE == SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION.
  7  1  The bill provides that the department may suspend or revoke
  7  2 a  certificate of acceptance if it determines that the
  7  3 board is not conducting the program in a manner consistent
  7  4 with the certificate of acceptance.  If a certificate is
  7  5 suspended or revoked, a county may take measures to correct
  7  6 the inconsistencies and the department may reinstate the
  7  7 certificate with or without limitation.  The board may contest
  7  8 a departmental decision by bringing a contested case proceeding
  7  9 to be decided by the department of inspections and appeals.
  7 10    ENFORCEMENT.  The department's issuance of a certificate
  7 11 of acceptance does not limit the authority of the attorney
  7 12 general to enforce state groundwater protection regulations,
  7 13 and the board may refer any matter requiring enforcement to the
  7 14 attorney general or a county attorney for judicial enforcement.
  7 15    VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.  The bill provides for both
  7 16 administrative and judicial enforcement of violations of
  7 17 state groundwater protection regulations.  The board may
  7 18 assess, impose, and collect civil penalties up to $10,000
  7 19 (Code section 455B.109).  The board may also seek judicial
  7 20 enforcement of civil penalties not to exceed $5,000 per each
  7 21 day of a violation (Code section 455B.191).  A person who fails
  7 22 to prevent surface water from draining into an agricultural
  7 23 drainage well is subject to a civil penalty of not more than
  7 24 $1,000 (Code sections 460.202, 460.203, and 460.206), and a
  7 25 person who constructs or expands an earthen storage structure
  7 26 within an agricultural drainage well area is subject to a civil
  7 27 penalty of not more than $5,000 for each day of the violation
  7 28 (Code sections 460.205 and 460.206).
  7 29    Criminal penalties also apply.  A person who negligently or
  7 30 knowingly disposes of a pollutant in a water of the state is
  7 31 guilty of a serious misdemeanor or an aggravated misdemeanor
  7 32 depending on the type of violation, punishable by a range of
  7 33 fines and imprisonment (Code sections 455B.186 and 455B.191).
  7 34    Moneys assessed as part of an administrative or civil
  7 35 proceeding are to be credited to the state in the same
  8  1 manner as if the department had not issued a certificate of
  8  2 acceptance.  Civil penalties assessed by the department must
  8  3 be deposited in the general fund of the state (Code section
  8  4 455B.109).  Moneys from civil penalties assessed for violations
  8  5 involving animal feeding operations are to be credited to the
  8  6 Iowa nutrient research fund created in section 466B.46 (Code
  8  7 sections 459.602, 459.603, 459A.502, and 459B.402).  Moneys
  8  8 from civil penalties for violations involving contamination of
  8  9 groundwater from agricultural drainage wells are credited to
  8 10 the livestock remediation fund (Code section 459.501).  Moneys
  8 11 from criminal fines and restitution awarded to the attorney
  8 12 general as part of a judgment in an environmental criminal case
  8 13 are credited to the environmental crimes investigation and
  8 14 prosecution fund (Code section 455B.112A).
  5 34    A county board of supervisors issued a certificate of
  5 35 acceptance to conduct a county groundwater pollution control
  6  1 program by the department pursuant to chapter 455B, division
  6  2 III, part 1, may administer and enforce the provisions of this
  6  3 chapter within sensitive groundwater access areas located in
  6  4 the county.

  6  5                           EXPLANATION
  6  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  8    GENERAL.  This bill authorizes the department of natural
  6  9 resources to cede some of its authority to administer certain
  6 10 environmental statutes and its rules to a county board of
  6 11 supervisors upon the board's request.  A board that has been
  6 12 granted such authority conducts a county groundwater pollution
  6 13 control program according to the terms of a certificate of
  6 14 acceptance issued by the department.
  6 15    CERTIFICATE OF ACCEPTANCE == ISSUANCE.  A certificate of
  6 16 acceptance allows a county board of supervisors to administer
  6 17 and enforce state groundwater protection regulations that  apply
  6 18 to sources that are located in sensitive groundwater access
  6 19 areas (where there is karst terrain, or land where there is
  6 20 located an agricultural drainage well area, or known sinkhole).
  6 21 The regulations are limited to those in statute or rule under
  6 22 Code chapter 455B, division I and division III (providing
  6 23 general authority and water quality regulations); Code chapter
  6 24 459, subchapter III, and Code chapters 459, 459A, and 459B
  6 25 (providing for water quality regulation applicable to animal
  6 26 feeding operations); and Code chapter 460 (regulating sources
  6 27 that may contaminate groundwater from agricultural drainage
  6 28 wells).  The department may approve or disapprove a request
  6 29 but cannot limit or qualify the certificate of acceptance or
  6 30 reduce the scope of the certificate of acceptance so that it
  6 31 cedes less authority to conduct the program than requested by
  6 32 the board.  A county board of supervisors may adopt  ordinances,
  6 33 rules, or standards either consistent with or more strict than
  6 34 state law.
  6 35    CERTIFICATE OF ACCEPTANCE == SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION.
  7  1  The bill provides that the department may suspend or revoke
  7  2 a  certificate of acceptance if it determines that the
  7  3 board is not conducting the program in a manner consistent
  7  4 with the certificate of acceptance.  If a certificate is
  7  5 suspended or revoked, a county may take measures to correct
  7  6 the inconsistencies and the department may reinstate the
  7  7 certificate with or without limitation.  The board may contest
  7  8 a departmental decision by bringing a contested case proceeding
  7  9 to be decided by the department of inspections and appeals.
  7 10    ENFORCEMENT.  The department's issuance of a certificate
  7 11 of acceptance does not limit the authority of the attorney
  7 12 general to enforce state groundwater protection regulations,
  7 13 and the board may refer any matter requiring enforcement to the
  7 14 attorney general or a county attorney for judicial enforcement.
  7 15    VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.  The bill provides for both
  7 16 administrative and judicial enforcement of violations of
  7 17 state groundwater protection regulations.  The board may
  7 18 assess, impose, and collect civil penalties up to $10,000
  7 19 (Code section 455B.109).  The board may also seek judicial
  7 20 enforcement of civil penalties not to exceed $5,000 per each
  7 21 day of a violation (Code section 455B.191).  A person who fails
  7 22 to prevent surface water from draining into an agricultural
  7 23 drainage well is subject to a civil penalty of not more than
  7 24 $1,000 (Code sections 460.202, 460.203, and 460.206), and a
  7 25 person who constructs or expands an earthen storage structure
  7 26 within an agricultural drainage well area is subject to a civil
  7 27 penalty of not more than $5,000 for each day of the violation
  7 28 (Code sections 460.205 and 460.206).
  7 29    Criminal penalties also apply.  A person who negligently or
  7 30 knowingly disposes of a pollutant in a water of the state is
  7 31 guilty of a serious misdemeanor or an aggravated misdemeanor
  7 32 depending on the type of violation, punishable by a range of
  7 33 fines and imprisonment (Code sections 455B.186 and 455B.191).
  7 34    Moneys assessed as part of an administrative or civil
  7 35 proceeding are to be credited to the state in the same
  8  1 manner as if the department had not issued a certificate of
  8  2 acceptance.  Civil penalties assessed by the department must
  8  3 be deposited in the general fund of the state (Code section
  8  4 455B.109).  Moneys from civil penalties assessed for violations
  8  5 involving animal feeding operations are to be credited to the
  8  6 Iowa nutrient research fund created in section 466B.46 (Code
  8  7 sections 459.602, 459.603, 459A.502, and 459B.402).  Moneys
  8  8 from civil penalties for violations involving contamination of
  8  9 groundwater from agricultural drainage wells are credited to
  8 10 the livestock remediation fund (Code section 459.501).  Moneys
  8 11 from criminal fines and restitution awarded to the attorney
  8 12 general as part of a judgment in an environmental criminal case
  8 13 are credited to the environmental crimes investigation and
  8 14 prosecution fund (Code section 455B.112A).
  6  2 III, part 1, may administer and enforce the provisions of this
  6  3 chapter within sensitive groundwater access areas located in
  6  4 the county.

  6  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  6  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  6  8    GENERAL.  This bill authorizes the department of natural
  6  9 resources to cede some of its authority to administer certain
  6 10 environmental statutes and its rules to a county board of
  6 11 supervisors upon the board's request.  A board that has been
  6 12 granted such authority conducts a county groundwater pollution
  6 13 control program according to the terms of a certificate of
  6 14 acceptance issued by the department.
  6 15    CERTIFICATE OF ACCEPTANCE == ISSUANCE.  A certificate of
  6 16 acceptance allows a county board of supervisors to administer
  6 17 and enforce state groundwater protection regulations that  apply
  6 18 to sources that are located in sensitive groundwater access
  6 19 areas (where there is karst terrain, or land where there is
  6 20 located an agricultural drainage well area, or known sinkhole).
  6 21 The regulations are limited to those in statute or rule under
  6 22 Code chapter 455B, division I and division III (providing
  6 23 general authority and water quality regulations); Code chapter
  6 24 459, subchapter III, and Code chapters 459, 459A, and 459B
  6 25 (providing for water quality regulation applicable to animal
  6 26 feeding operations); and Code chapter 460 (regulating sources
  6 27 that may contaminate groundwater from agricultural drainage
  6 28 wells).  The department may approve or disapprove a request
  6 29 but cannot limit or qualify the certificate of acceptance or
  6 30 reduce the scope of the certificate of acceptance so that it
  6 31 cedes less authority to conduct the program than requested by
  6 32 the board.  A county board of supervisors may adopt  ordinances,
  6 33 rules, or standards either consistent with or more strict than
  6 34 state law.
  6 35    CERTIFICATE OF ACCEPTANCE == SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION.
  7  1  The bill provides that the department may suspend or revoke
  7  2 a  certificate of acceptance if it determines that the
  7  3 board is not conducting the program in a manner consistent
  7  4 with the certificate of acceptance.  If a certificate is
  7  5 suspended or revoked, a county may take measures to correct
  7  6 the inconsistencies and the department may reinstate the
  7  7 certificate with or without limitation.  The board may contest
  7  8 a departmental decision by bringing a contested case proceeding
  7  9 to be decided by the department of inspections and appeals.
  7 10    ENFORCEMENT.  The department's issuance of a certificate
  7 11 of acceptance does not limit the authority of the attorney
  7 12 general to enforce state groundwater protection regulations,
  7 13 and the board may refer any matter requiring enforcement to the
  7 14 attorney general or a county attorney for judicial enforcement.
  7 15    VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.  The bill provides for both
  7 16 administrative and judicial enforcement of violations of
  7 17 state groundwater protection regulations.  The board may
  7 18 assess, impose, and collect civil penalties up to $10,000
  7 19 (Code section 455B.109).  The board may also seek judicial
  7 20 enforcement of civil penalties not to exceed $5,000 per each
  7 21 day of a violation (Code section 455B.191).  A person who fails
  7 22 to prevent surface water from draining into an agricultural
  7 23 drainage well is subject to a civil penalty of not more than
  7 24 $1,000 (Code sections 460.202, 460.203, and 460.206), and a
  7 25 person who constructs or expands an earthen storage structure
  7 26 within an agricultural drainage well area is subject to a civil
  7 27 penalty of not more than $5,000 for each day of the violation
  7 28 (Code sections 460.205 and 460.206).
  7 29    Criminal penalties also apply.  A person who negligently or
  7 30 knowingly disposes of a pollutant in a water of the state is
  7 31 guilty of a serious misdemeanor or an aggravated misdemeanor
  7 32 depending on the type of violation, punishable by a range of
  7 33 fines and imprisonment (Code sections 455B.186 and 455B.191).
  7 34    Moneys assessed as part of an administrative or civil
  7 35 proceeding are to be credited to the state in the same
  8  1 manner as if the department had not issued a certificate of
  8  2 acceptance.  Civil penalties assessed by the department must

  6  8    GENERAL.  This bill authorizes the department of natural
  6  9 resources to cede some of its authority to administer certain
  6 10 environmental statutes and its rules to a county board of
  6 11 supervisors upon the board's request.  A board that has been
  6 12 granted such authority conducts a county groundwater pollution
  6 13 control program according to the terms of a certificate of
  6 14 acceptance issued by the department.
  6 15    CERTIFICATE OF ACCEPTANCE == ISSUANCE.  A certificate of
  6 16 acceptance allows a county board of supervisors to administer
  6 17 and enforce state groundwater protection regulations that  apply
  6 18 to sources that are located in sensitive groundwater access
  6 19 areas (where there is karst terrain, or land where there is
  6 20 located an agricultural drainage well area, or known sinkhole).
  6 21 The regulations are limited to those in statute or rule under
  6 22 Code chapter 455B, division I and division III (providing
  6 23 general authority and water quality regulations); Code chapter
  6 24 459, subchapter III, and Code chapters 459, 459A, and 459B
  6 25 (providing for water quality regulation applicable to animal
  6 26 feeding operations); and Code chapter 460 (regulating sources
  6 27 that may contaminate groundwater from agricultural drainage
  6 28 wells).  The department may approve or disapprove a request
  6 29 but cannot limit or qualify the certificate of acceptance or
  6 30 reduce the scope of the certificate of acceptance so that it
  6 31 cedes less authority to conduct the program than requested by
  6 32 the board.  A county board of supervisors may adopt  ordinances,
  6 33 rules, or standards either consistent with or more strict than
  6 34 state law.
  6 35    CERTIFICATE OF ACCEPTANCE == SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION.
  7  1  The bill provides that the department may suspend or revoke
  7  2 a  certificate of acceptance if it determines that the
  7  3 board is not conducting the program in a manner consistent
  7  4 with the certificate of acceptance.  If a certificate is
  7  5 suspended or revoked, a county may take measures to correct
  7  6 the inconsistencies and the department may reinstate the
  7  7 certificate with or without limitation.  The board may contest
  7  8 a departmental decision by bringing a contested case proceeding
  7  9 to be decided by the department of inspections and appeals.
  7 10    ENFORCEMENT.  The department's issuance of a certificate
  7 11 of acceptance does not limit the authority of the attorney
  7 12 general to enforce state groundwater protection regulations,
  7 13 and the board may refer any matter requiring enforcement to the
  7 14 attorney general or a county attorney for judicial enforcement.
  7 15    VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.  The bill provides for both
  7 16 administrative and judicial enforcement of violations of
  7 17 state groundwater protection regulations.  The board may
  7 18 assess, impose, and collect civil penalties up to $10,000
  7 19 (Code section 455B.109).  The board may also seek judicial
  7 20 enforcement of civil penalties not to exceed $5,000 per each
  7 21 day of a violation (Code section 455B.191).  A person who fails
  7 22 to prevent surface water from draining into an agricultural
  7 23 drainage well is subject to a civil penalty of not more than
  7 24 $1,000 (Code sections 460.202, 460.203, and 460.206), and a
  7 25 person who constructs or expands an earthen storage structure
  7 26 within an agricultural drainage well area is subject to a civil
  7 27 penalty of not more than $5,000 for each day of the violation
  7 28 (Code sections 460.205 and 460.206).
  7 29    Criminal penalties also apply.  A person who negligently or
  7 30 knowingly disposes of a pollutant in a water of the state is
  7 31 guilty of a serious misdemeanor or an aggravated misdemeanor
  7 32 depending on the type of violation, punishable by a range of
  7 33 fines and imprisonment (Code sections 455B.186 and 455B.191).
  7 34    Moneys assessed as part of an administrative or civil
  7 35 proceeding are to be credited to the state in the same
  8  1 manner as if the department had not issued a certificate of
  8  2 acceptance.  Civil penalties assessed by the department must
  8  3 be deposited in the general fund of the state (Code section
  8  4 455B.109).  Moneys from civil penalties assessed for violations
  8  5 involving animal feeding operations are to be credited to the
  8  6 Iowa nutrient research fund created in section 466B.46 (Code
  8  7 sections 459.602, 459.603, 459A.502, and 459B.402).  Moneys
  8  8 from civil penalties for violations involving contamination of
  8  9 groundwater from agricultural drainage wells are credited to
  8 10 the livestock remediation fund (Code section 459.501).  Moneys
  8 11 from criminal fines and restitution awarded to the attorney
  8 12 general as part of a judgment in an environmental criminal case
  8 13 are credited to the environmental crimes investigation and
  8 14 prosecution fund (Code section 455B.112A).

  6  8    GENERAL.  This bill authorizes the department of natural
  6  9 resources to cede some of its authority to administer certain
  6 10 environmental statutes and its rules to a county board of

  6 12 granted such authority conducts a county groundwater pollution
  6 13 control program according to the terms of a certificate of
  6 14 acceptance issued by the department.
  6 15    CERTIFICATE OF ACCEPTANCE == ISSUANCE.  A certificate of
  6 16 acceptance allows a county board of supervisors to administer
  6 17 and enforce state groundwater protection regulations that  apply
  6 18 to sources that are located in sensitive groundwater access
  6 19 areas (where there is karst terrain, or land where there is
  6 20 located an agricultural drainage well area, or known sinkhole).
  6 21 The regulations are limited to those in statute or rule under
  6 22 Code chapter 455B, division I and division III (providing
  6 23 general authority and water quality regulations); Code chapter
  6 24 459, subchapter III, and Code chapters 459, 459A, and 459B
  6 25 (providing for water quality regulation applicable to animal
  6 26 feeding operations); and Code chapter 460 (regulating sources
  6 27 that may contaminate groundwater from agricultural drainage
  6 28 wells).  The department may approve or disapprove a request
  6 29 but cannot limit or qualify the certificate of acceptance or
  6 30 reduce the scope of the certificate of acceptance so that it
  6 31 cedes less authority to conduct the program than requested by
  6 32 the board.  A county board of supervisors may adopt  ordinances,
  6 33 rules, or standards either consistent with or more strict than
  6 34 state law.
  6 35    CERTIFICATE OF ACCEPTANCE == SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION.
  7  1  The bill provides that the department may suspend or revoke
  7  2 a  certificate of acceptance if it determines that the
  7  3 board is not conducting the program in a manner consistent
  7  4 with the certificate of acceptance.  If a certificate is
  7  5 suspended or revoked, a county may take measures to correct
  7  6 the inconsistencies and the department may reinstate the
  7  7 certificate with or without limitation.  The board may contest
  7  8 a departmental decision by bringing a contested case proceeding
  7  9 to be decided by the department of inspections and appeals.
  7 10    ENFORCEMENT.  The department's issuance of a certificate
  7 11 of acceptance does not limit the authority of the attorney
  7 12 general to enforce state groundwater protection regulations,
  7 13 and the board may refer any matter requiring enforcement to the
  7 14 attorney general or a county attorney for judicial enforcement.
  7 15    VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.  The bill provides for both
  7 16 administrative and judicial enforcement of violations of
  7 17 state groundwater protection regulations.  The board may
  7 18 assess, impose, and collect civil penalties up to $10,000
  7 19 (Code section 455B.109).  The board may also seek judicial
  7 20 enforcement of civil penalties not to exceed $5,000 per each
  7 21 day of a violation (Code section 455B.191).  A person who fails
  7 22 to prevent surface water from draining into an agricultural
  7 23 drainage well is subject to a civil penalty of not more than
  7 24 $1,000 (Code sections 460.202, 460.203, and 460.206), and a
  7 25 person who constructs or expands an earthen storage structure
  7 26 within an agricultural drainage well area is subject to a civil
  7 27 penalty of not more than $5,000 for each day of the violation
  7 28 (Code sections 460.205 and 460.206).
  7 29    Criminal penalties also apply.  A person who negligently or

  7 31 guilty of a serious misdemeanor or an aggravated misdemeanor
  7 32 depending on the type of violation, punishable by a range of

  7 34    Moneys assessed as part of an administrative or civil
  7 35 proceeding are to be credited to the state in the same
  8  1 manner as if the department had not issued a certificate of
  8  2 acceptance.  Civil penalties assessed by the department must
  8  3 be deposited in the general fund of the state (Code section
  8  4 455B.109).  Moneys from civil penalties assessed for violations
  8  5 involving animal feeding operations are to be credited to the
  8  6 Iowa nutrient research fund created in section 466B.46 (Code
  8  7 sections 459.602, 459.603, 459A.502, and 459B.402).  Moneys
