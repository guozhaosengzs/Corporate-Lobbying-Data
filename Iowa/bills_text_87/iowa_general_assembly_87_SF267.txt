 17 27                           EXPLANATION
 17 28 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 29 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 30    This bill relates to criminal asset forfeiture.
 17 31    Asset forfeiture is a process by which contraband and
 17 32 proceeds or instrumentalities related to criminal activity
 17 33 may be seized by the state and sold. Under current law,
 17 34 asset forfeiture is governed by Code chapter 809A.  The bill
 17 35 repeals Code chapter 809A and replaces it with new Code chapter
 18  1 809B.   Currently under Code chapter 809A, a conviction for a
 18  2 criminal offense is not required for an asset to be subject to
 18  3 forfeiture, and forfeiture need not be expressly authorized
 18  4 as a penalty in the criminal statute. The bill provides that
 18  5 property is not subject to forfeiture until a person has
 18  6 been convicted of a felony for which forfeiture is expressly
 18  7 authorized as a penalty.
 18  8    Under current law, forfeiture is provided as a remedy for
 18  9 certain driving while intoxicated offenses and for violations
 18 10 of Code chapters 706B (money laundering), 715A (forgery
 18 11 and related fraudulent criminal acts), and 716A (electronic
 18 12 mail). The bill provides that forfeiture is also a remedy for
 18 13 violations of Code chapters 124 (controlled substances) and
 18 14 124A (imitation controlled substances) and Code section 714.26
 18 15 (intellectual property counterfeiting).
 18 16    The bill exempts homestead real property, motor vehicles of
 18 17 less than $10,000 in market value, and United States currency
 18 18 totaling $200 or less from forfeiture.
 18 19    Current law requires the state to prove that property is
 18 20 subject to forfeiture by a preponderance of the evidence. The
 18 21 bill requires the state to prove, by clear and convincing
 18 22 evidence, that the property is forfeitable.
 18 23    The bill provides that a defendant is not jointly and
 18 24 severally liable for forfeiture awards owed by other
 18 25 defendants.
 18 26    The bill provides for a proportionality hearing, where
 18 27 the defendant may petition the court that the forfeiture is
 18 28 unconstitutionally excessive.
 18 29    The bill requires law enforcement agencies to provide annual
 18 30 reports to the department of revenue regarding forfeitures
 18 31 completed by the law enforcement agencies. The bill requires
 18 32 the department of revenue to prepare an annual report
 18 33 aggregating the results and to post the aggregate report on the
 18 34 department's internet site.
 18 35    The bill provides that new Code chapter 809B preempts laws by
 19  1 county, city, township, and other tribal and local governments
 19  2 in the state which regulate civil and criminal forfeiture.
 19  3    The bill makes conforming changes relating to the repeal of
 19  4 Code chapter 809A and new Code chapter 809B.
 19  5    The bill applies to forfeiture proceedings that arise on or
 19  6 after or that are pending as of the effective date of the bill.
