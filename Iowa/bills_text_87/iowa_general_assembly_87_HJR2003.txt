  3  5 the government.
  3  6    The joint resolution provides that a victim includes any
  3  7 person who is directly and proximately harmed by the commission
  3  8 of a criminal offense or delinquent act, and does not include
  3  9 the defendant or a person the court finds would not act in the
  3 10 best interests of a victim who is deceased, incompetent, or
  3 11 incapacitated, or a minor.
  3 12    The resolution, if adopted, would be published and then
