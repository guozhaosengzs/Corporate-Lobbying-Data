  2  3                           EXPLANATION
  2  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  6    Current law limits beverage containers subject to beverage
  2  7 containers control deposit and refund provisions to containers
  2  8 holding wine, alcoholic liquor, beer, mineral water, soda
  2  9 water, and carbonated soft drinks. When a distributor sells
  2 10 beverages in eligible containers to a dealer, the distributor
  2 11 attaches an extra 5 cents per eligible container to the sale
  2 12 price. When a dealer sells beverages in eligible containers
  2 13 to a consumer, the dealer passes on the 5=cent deposit to the
  2 14 sale price. A consumer can take eligible beverage containers
  2 15 to a dealer, dealer agent, or a redemption center and receive
  2 16 a 5=cent refund for every eligible beverage container that
  2 17 the consumer returns. A distributor collects eligible
  2 18 containers from a dealer, dealer agent, or redemption center,
  2 19 at which time the distributor pays the dealer, dealer agent,
  2 20 or redemption center 5 cents per eligible container plus a
  2 21 handling fee of an additional 1 cent per empty container.
  2 22    This bill expands the list of eligible beverage containers
  2 23 by including "sports drinks" as defined in the bill in the
  2 24 definition of "beverage". Further, the bill increases
  2 25 the refund and deposit amount from 5 cents to 10 cents for
  2 26 all beverage containers subject to the deposit and refund
  2 27 provisions. The bill does not affect the handling fee of
  2 28 1 cent per empty container that a dealer, dealer agent, or
  2 29 redemption center will charge a distributor.

  2  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2  6    Current law limits beverage containers subject to beverage
  2  7 containers control deposit and refund provisions to containers
  2  8 holding wine, alcoholic liquor, beer, mineral water, soda
  2  9 water, and carbonated soft drinks. When a distributor sells
  2 10 beverages in eligible containers to a dealer, the distributor
  2 11 attaches an extra 5 cents per eligible container to the sale
  2 12 price. When a dealer sells beverages in eligible containers
  2 13 to a consumer, the dealer passes on the 5=cent deposit to the
  2 14 sale price. A consumer can take eligible beverage containers
  2 15 to a dealer, dealer agent, or a redemption center and receive
  2 16 a 5=cent refund for every eligible beverage container that
  2 17 the consumer returns. A distributor collects eligible
  2 18 containers from a dealer, dealer agent, or redemption center,
  2 19 at which time the distributor pays the dealer, dealer agent,
  2 20 or redemption center 5 cents per eligible container plus a
  2 21 handling fee of an additional 1 cent per empty container.
  2 22    This bill expands the list of eligible beverage containers
  2 23 by including "sports drinks" as defined in the bill in the
  2 24 definition of "beverage". Further, the bill increases
  2 25 the refund and deposit amount from 5 cents to 10 cents for
  2 26 all beverage containers subject to the deposit and refund
  2 27 provisions. The bill does not affect the handling fee of

  2 29 redemption center will charge a distributor.
