proceeding
held
after
the

of
the
initial
trial
2


proceeding.
3


Under
the
bill,
a

penalty
sentence
could
be
imposed
if
4


the
murder
would
constitute

in
the
first
degree
and
the

18


The
bill
specifies
that
the

19


all

and
proceedings
involving
capital

when
20


in
the
attorney

judgment
the
interest
of
the
state
21


requires
the
attorney
general
to
intervene
on

of
the
22


county
attorney,
or
upon
request
by
the
county
attorney.
23


If
a

is
indigent
and
is
charged
with
capital
murder,
24


payment
of
costs
for
two
attorneys
is
authorized.
The
supreme
25


court
is
required
to
establish
standards
for
the

The
state
public

is
27


charged
with
establishing
teams
of
qualified
lead
and
cocounsel
28


for
death
penalty
cases,
as
well
as
conducting
or
sponsoring
29


specialized
training
programs
for
attorneys
representing
30


persons
who
may
be
executed.
31


If
a

murder
case
proceeds
to

Once
the
evidence
is
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
court
2


will
instruct
the
jury,
at
the
defendant’s
request,
that
in
3


considering
whether
a
sentence
of
death
is
justified,
the

race,
color,
religious

chapter
216
of
the

or

of
any

is
not
to
be
considered.
The
supreme
court
7


shall
collect
evidence
relating
to
whether
the
death
sentences
8


imposed
are
excessive,
disproportionate,
or
imposed
under
the
9


influence
of
prejudice
at
trial
which
will
be
available
to
10


litigants.
11


The
sentence
of
death
is
imposed
only
when
the
trier
of
fact
12


(the
jury
or
the
court
if
the
defendant
has
waived
the
right
to
13


a
jury
trial)
unanimously
answers
two
questions
affirmatively:
14


(1)
whether
aggravating
circumstances
established
beyond
15


a
reasonable
doubt
outweigh
any
mitigating
circumstances
16


that
may
exist;
and
(2)
whether
the
defendant
should
be
17


sentenced
to
death.
Mitigating
factors
the
trier
of
fact
may
18


consider
include
the
following:
the
defendant
was
under
the
19


influence
of
an
extreme
mental
or
emotional
disturbance;
the
20


age
of
the
defendant;
the
defendant’s
ability
to
appreciate
21


the
wrongfulness
of
the
conduct
due
to
mental
disease
but
22


not
to
a
degree
to
constitute
a
defense;
the
defendant
has
23


no
significant
prior
criminal
history;
the
defendant
was
24


under
extreme
duress;
the
defendant
did
not
directly
commit
25


the
murder;
and
the
defendant’s
character
or
record
or
the
26


circumstances
of
the
offense.
The
sentencing
proceeding
is
27


conducted
separately
from
the
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence
by
28


the
same
trier
of
fact.
29


For
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
trier
of
fact
(the
jury
30


or
the
court
if
the
defendant
has
waived
the
right
to
have
31


the
jury
hear
the
proceedings)
is
to
weigh
any
aggravating
32


circumstances
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by
the
33


state
against
any
of
the
enumerated
mitigating
circumstances
34


which
may
be
presented
by
the
defendant.

in
any

proceeding
to
determine
the

If
the
jury
fails
to
2


agree
unanimously
on
the
required
affirmative
findings,
the
3


penalty
imposed
would
be
life
imprisonment.
4


The
death
penalty
sentence
would
be
reviewed
automatically
5


by
the
supreme
court.
The
supreme
court
shall
review
the
trial
6


and
judgment
separately
from
the
sentencing
proceeding.
If
the
7


supreme
court
finds
error
in
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
8


supreme
court
may
remand
the
case
back
to
district
court
for
a
9


new
sentencing
hearing.
The
bill
requires
the
supreme
court
to
10


examine
whether
the
sentence
is
excessive
or
disproportionate
11


to
penalties
in
similar
cases.
If
affirmed
by
the
supreme
12


court,
the
penalty
would
be
accomplished
by
lethal
injection.
13


The
bill
requires
the
board
of
corrections
to
adopt
rules
14


pertaining
to
executions,
including
rules
pertaining
to
the
15


witnessing
of
executions.
16


A
person
who
is
sentenced
to
death,
but
who
is
pregnant
when
17


the
warrant
of
execution
is
issued,
is
not
to
be
executed
until
18


the
person
is
no
longer
pregnant.
A
procedure
is
also
provided
19


to
stay
execution
of
a
condemned
inmate
who
becomes
insane
20


after
conviction
but
before
execution.
21


An
employee
of
the
state
shall
not
be
required
to
perform
or
22


assist
in
any
execution
and
shall
not
be
discriminated
against
23


for
refusing
to
participate.
24


The
bill
may
include
a
state
mandate
as
defined
in
Code
25


section
25B.3.
The
bill
makes
inapplicable
Code
section
25B.2,
26


subsection
3,
which
would
relieve
a
political
subdivision
from
27


complying
with
a
state
mandate
if
funding
for
the
cost
of
28


the
state
mandate
is
not
provided
or
specified.
Therefore,
29


political
subdivisions
are
required
to
comply
with
any
state
30


mandate
included
in
the
bill.
31


The
bill
contains
severability
provisions
and
takes
effect
32


January
1,
2019,
and
applies
only
to
offenses
committed
