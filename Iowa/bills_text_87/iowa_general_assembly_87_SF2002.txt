  1  4      1  4      1  5 marks or caps have been placed on trees or posts around the
  1  6 area where entry is forbidden.  Each purple mark must be either
  1  7 of the following:
  1  8    (A)  A vertical line on a tree of at least eight inches in
  1  9 length and the bottom of the mark must be no less than three
  1 10 feet and no more than five feet above the ground.  Such marks
  1 11 must be placed no more than one hundred feet apart and must be
  1 12 readily visible to any person approaching the property.

  1 15 no less than three feet and no more than five feet, six inches
  1 16 above the ground.  Posts so capped or marked must be placed no
  1 17 more than thirty=six feet apart and must be readily visible
  1 18 to any person approaching the property.  Prior to applying
  1 19 a cap or mark which is visible from and could reasonably be
  1 20 construed to apply to property on both sides of a fence shared
  1 21 by different property owners, lessees, or others in lawful
  1 22 possession, all such owners, lessees, or others in lawful
  1 23 possession shall concur in the decision to apply a cap or mark
  1 24 to the fence.
  1 25    (ii)  (A)  This subparagraph division (c) shall not be
  1 26 construed to authorize an owner, lessee, or other person in
  1 27 lawful possession of any property to place any purple marks or
  1 28 caps on any tree or post or to install any post or fence if
  1 29 doing so would violate any applicable law, rule, ordinance,
  1 30 order, covenant, bylaw, declaration, regulation, restriction,
  1 31 or instrument.
  1 32    (B)  This subparagraph division (c) does not apply to real

  2  6    Sec. 2.  DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING MARKING
  2  7 PROCEDURES.  The departments of agriculture and land

  2 10 interpretation of section 716.7, subsection 2, paragraph
  2 11 "a", subparagraph (2), subparagraph division (c).  The
  2 12 information provided shall inform the public about the
  2 13 marking requirements, including information regarding the
  2 14 size requirements of the markings as well as the manner
  2 15 in which the markings must be placed.  The departments of
  2 16 agriculture and land stewardship and natural resources shall
  2 17 also include information in the campaign that, prior to
  2 18 July 1, 2019, any owner, lessee, or other person in lawful
  2 19 possession who chooses to place purple markings or caps on
  2 20 such person's property, must comply with one of the other
  2 21 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,
  2 22 paragraph "a", subparagraph (2), to meet the definition of
  2 23 trespass.  The departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  2 24 and natural resources may prepare a brochure, disseminate the
  2 25 information through agency internet sites, or collaborate with
  2 26 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 27 of the information.
  2 28                           EXPLANATION
  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 32 trespassing.
  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.
  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  6 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  7 trespassers on notice.
  4  8    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  9 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4 10 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 11 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 12 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 13 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 14 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 15 the information.
  4 16    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 17 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 18 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
  4 19 provisions of the bill.

  2  9 campaign for the public concerning the implementation and
  2 10 interpretation of section 716.7, subsection 2, paragraph
  2 11 "a", subparagraph (2), subparagraph division (c).  The
  2 12 information provided shall inform the public about the
  2 13 marking requirements, including information regarding the
  2 14 size requirements of the markings as well as the manner
  2 15 in which the markings must be placed.  The departments of
  2 16 agriculture and land stewardship and natural resources shall
  2 17 also include information in the campaign that, prior to
  2 18 July 1, 2019, any owner, lessee, or other person in lawful
  2 19 possession who chooses to place purple markings or caps on
  2 20 such person's property, must comply with one of the other
  2 21 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,
  2 22 paragraph "a", subparagraph (2), to meet the definition of
  2 23 trespass.  The departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  2 24 and natural resources may prepare a brochure, disseminate the
  2 25 information through agency internet sites, or collaborate with
  2 26 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 27 of the information.

  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and

  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.
  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  6 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  7 trespassers on notice.
  4  8    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  9 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4 10 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 11 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 12 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 13 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 14 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 15 the information.
  4 16    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 17 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 18 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
  4 19 provisions of the bill.

  2  7 PROCEDURES.  The departments of agriculture and land
  2  8 stewardship and natural resources shall conduct an information
  2  9 campaign for the public concerning the implementation and
  2 10 interpretation of section 716.7, subsection 2, paragraph

  2 12 information provided shall inform the public about the
  2 13 marking requirements, including information regarding the
  2 14 size requirements of the markings as well as the manner
  2 15 in which the markings must be placed.  The departments of
  2 16 agriculture and land stewardship and natural resources shall
  2 17 also include information in the campaign that, prior to
  2 18 July 1, 2019, any owner, lessee, or other person in lawful
  2 19 possession who chooses to place purple markings or caps on
  2 20 such person's property, must comply with one of the other
  2 21 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,
  2 22 paragraph "a", subparagraph (2), to meet the definition of
  2 23 trespass.  The departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  2 24 and natural resources may prepare a brochure, disseminate the
  2 25 information through agency internet sites, or collaborate with
  2 26 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 27 of the information.
  2 28                           EXPLANATION
  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 32 trespassing.
  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.
  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  6 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  7 trespassers on notice.
  4  8    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  9 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4 10 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 11 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 12 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 13 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 14 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 15 the information.
  4 16    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 17 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 18 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the

  2 26 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 27 of the information.
  2 28                           EXPLANATION
  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 32 trespassing.
  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or

  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section

  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person

  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.
  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  6 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  7 trespassers on notice.
  4  8    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  9 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4 10 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 11 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to

  2 26 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 27 of the information.

  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees

  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following

  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.
  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  6 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  7 trespassers on notice.
  4  8    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  9 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4 10 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 11 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 12 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 13 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or

  2 16 agriculture and land stewardship and natural resources shall
  2 17 also include information in the campaign that, prior to
  2 18 July 1, 2019, any owner, lessee, or other person in lawful
  2 19 possession who chooses to place purple markings or caps on
  2 20 such person's property, must comply with one of the other
  2 21 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,
  2 22 paragraph "a", subparagraph (2), to meet the definition of
  2 23 trespass.  The departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  2 24 and natural resources may prepare a brochure, disseminate the
  2 25 information through agency internet sites, or collaborate with
  2 26 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 27 of the information.
  2 28                           EXPLANATION
  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 32 trespassing.
  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.
  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  6 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  7 trespassers on notice.
  4  8    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  9 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4 10 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 11 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 12 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 13 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 14 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 15 the information.
  4 16    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 17 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 18 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
  4 19 provisions of the bill.

  1 23 possession shall concur in the decision to apply a cap or mark
  1 24 to the fence.
  1 25    (ii)  (A)  This subparagraph division (c) shall not be
  1 26 construed to authorize an owner, lessee, or other person in
  1 27 lawful possession of any property to place any purple marks or
  1 28 caps on any tree or post or to install any post or fence if
  1 29 doing so would violate any applicable law, rule, ordinance,

  2  3    (D)  Prior to July 1, 2019, notice provided by the method
  2  4 described in this subparagraph division (c) is not valid or
  2  5 enforcable.  This subparagraph part is repealed July 1, 2023.
  2  6    Sec. 2.  DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING MARKING
  2  7 PROCEDURES.  The departments of agriculture and land
  2  8 stewardship and natural resources shall conduct an information
  2  9 campaign for the public concerning the implementation and

  2 11 "a", subparagraph (2), subparagraph division (c).  The
  2 12 information provided shall inform the public about the
  2 13 marking requirements, including information regarding the
  2 14 size requirements of the markings as well as the manner
  2 15 in which the markings must be placed.  The departments of
  2 16 agriculture and land stewardship and natural resources shall
  2 17 also include information in the campaign that, prior to
  2 18 July 1, 2019, any owner, lessee, or other person in lawful
  2 19 possession who chooses to place purple markings or caps on
  2 20 such person's property, must comply with one of the other
  2 21 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,
  2 22 paragraph "a", subparagraph (2), to meet the definition of
  2 23 trespass.  The departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  2 24 and natural resources may prepare a brochure, disseminate the
  2 25 information through agency internet sites, or collaborate with
  2 26 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 27 of the information.

  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is

  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch

  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than

  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the

  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.
  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  6 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  7 trespassers on notice.
  4  8    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  9 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4 10 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 11 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 12 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 13 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 14 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 15 the information.

  4 17 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 18 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the

  2 21 notice requirements listed in section 716.7, subsection 2,
  2 22 paragraph "a", subparagraph (2), to meet the definition of
  2 23 trespass.  The departments of agriculture and land stewardship

  2 26 nongovernmental organizations to assist in the dissemination
  2 27 of the information.
  2 28                           EXPLANATION
  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 32 trespassing.
  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.
  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  6 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  7 trespassers on notice.
  4  8    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  9 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4 10 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 11 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 12 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 13 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 14 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 15 the information.
  4 16    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 17 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 18 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
  4 19 provisions of the bill.

  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 32 trespassing.
  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.
  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  6 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  7 trespassers on notice.
  4  8    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  9 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4 10 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 11 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 12 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 13 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or

  2 28                           EXPLANATION
  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 32 trespassing.
  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.
  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  6 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  7 trespassers on notice.
  4  8    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  9 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4 10 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 11 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to

  2 28                           EXPLANATION
  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 32 trespassing.
  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.
  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  6 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  7 trespassers on notice.
  4  8    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  9 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4 10 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 11 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 12 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 13 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 14 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 15 the information.
  4 16    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 17 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 18 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
  4 19 provisions of the bill.

  2 28                           EXPLANATION
  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 32 trespassing.
  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.
  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  6 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  7 trespassers on notice.
  4  8    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  9 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4 10 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 11 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 12 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 13 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 14 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 15 the information.
  4 16    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 17 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 18 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
  4 19 provisions of the bill.

  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is

  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written

  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that

  2  9 campaign for the public concerning the implementation and
  2 10 interpretation of section 716.7, subsection 2, paragraph
  2 11 "a", subparagraph (2), subparagraph division (c).  The

  2 28                           EXPLANATION
  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 32 trespassing.
  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.
  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  6 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  7 trespassers on notice.
  4  8    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  9 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4 10 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 11 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 12 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 13 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 14 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 15 the information.
  4 16    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 17 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 18 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the

  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 32 trespassing.
  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall

  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 32 trespassing.
  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.

  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 32 trespassing.
  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably

  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 32 trespassing.
  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.
  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  6 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  7 trespassers on notice.
  4  8    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  9 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4 10 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 11 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 12 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 13 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 14 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 15 the information.

  4 17 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and

  2 28                           EXPLANATION
  2 29 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 30 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 31    This bill relates to notice that entry in or on property is
  2 32 trespassing.
  2 33    Under current law, criminal trespass includes entering or
  2 34 remaining upon or in property without justification after being
  2 35 notified or requested to abstain from entering or to vacate
  3  1 the property.  Current notification methods include personal
  3  2 notice, orally or in writing, and posting a printed or written
  3  3 notice.
  3  4    The bill establishes a new method for property owners,
  3  5 lessees, and other lawful possessors to provide notice
  3  6 that entry onto the property without permission constitutes
  3  7 criminal trespass.  Specifically, proposed new Code section
  3  8 716.7(2)(a)(2)(c) indicates that purple marks or caps on trees
  3  9 or posts around an area serves as notice that entry without
  3 10 permission into that area constitutes criminal trespass.  This
  3 11 new method of notification of trespass is an independent
  3 12 alternative to preexisting, codified methods of notification
  3 13 in Code section 716.7(2)(a)(2).
  3 14     The bill does not apply to certain employees entering onto
  3 15 property to perform certain work. The persons defined in Code
  3 16 section 716.7(3)(a)=(e) do not commit trespass when they enter
  3 17 upon such property to perform defined work.
  3 18    The bill specifies the size requirements of the marks and
  3 19 caps and when they may be used.  Marks and caps shall not be
  3 20 used and posts shall not be installed if doing so would violate
  3 21 any law or lawful agreement.  Additionally, this method shall
  3 22 not be used in a city with a population greater than 60,000.
  3 23    The marks on trees must consist of at least an eight=inch
  3 24 vertical line that is above the ground at between three feet
  3 25 and five feet.  Additionally, the marks must be no more than
  3 26 100 feet apart and they must be readily visible to a person
  3 27 approaching the property.
  3 28    Purple caps on fence posts must meet the following
  3 29 requirements.  The fence posts must be no more than 36 feet
  3 30 apart and readily visible to a person approaching the property.
  3 31 The cap or mark must be on the top two inches of the post.  The
  3 32 bottom of the cap must be between three feet and five feet,
  3 33 six inches above the ground.  Before putting a cap or mark on
  3 34 a post that is visible from both sides and could reasonably
  3 35 be construed to apply to property where another side is on
  4  1 property that is owned, leased, or lawfully possessed by
  4  2 someone else, the property owner must obtain agreement by that
  4  3 other person.
  4  4    The new method of providing notification applies on July
  4  5 1, 2019.  Prior to that date, property owners must use the
  4  6 methods currently provided for in the Code to place potential
  4  7 trespassers on notice.
  4  8    Prior to the applicability date of the purple marking notice
  4  9 method, the departments of agriculture and land stewardship
  4 10 and natural resources shall conduct an information campaign on
  4 11 the method, how it is defined in the Code, and how it is to
  4 12 be interpreted and implemented.  The departments may prepare
  4 13 a brochure, place information on agency internet sites, or
  4 14 collaborate with nongovernmental organizations to disseminate
  4 15 the information.
  4 16    The different levels of penalties provided for trespass
  4 17 that are set forth in Code sections 716.8, 481A.134, and
  4 18 481A.135 are applicable to a trespass committed pursuant to the
