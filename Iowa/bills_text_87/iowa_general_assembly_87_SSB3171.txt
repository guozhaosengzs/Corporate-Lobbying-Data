with
23


the
explanation’s
substance
by

This

26


Under
current

not
required

apply
27


heightened
scrutiny

heightened
scrutiny

that
state
action
cannot
31


substantially
burden
a
person’s
exercise
of
religion
unless
it
32


is
demonstrated
that
applying
the
law
of
general
applicability
33


is
in
furtherance
of
a
compelling
governmental
interest
and
is
34


the
least
restrictive
means
of
furthering
that
interest.
