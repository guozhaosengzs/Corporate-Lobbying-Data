  4  4 the treating physician to treat the injury.
  4  5    (3)  The commissioner shall not be bound by the advisory
  4  6 opinion of the insurance claims specialist.  Upon application,
  4  7 the workers' compensation commissioner shall conduct a hearing

  4 21 employer's agent cannot be immediately contacted to indicate
  4 22 who the employer has predesignated as a treating physician.
  4 23    (6)  The employer shall notify an injured employee of the
  4 24 employee's ability to contest the employer's choice of the

  5 13 is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent examination
  5 14 and evaluation of the employee's permanent disability by a
  5 15 physician of the employee's choice.  The physician chosen by
  5 16 the employee has the right to confer with and obtain sufficient
  5 17 medical history of the employee from the physician who examined
  5 18 the employee on behalf of the employer to make a proper
  5 19 evaluation of the employee's permanent disability.
  5 20    (4)  The employer shall promptly pay the costs of any

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.
 12 18    PROVIDER REGISTRIES ==== FEES ==== MEDICAL DIRECTOR.  New Code
 12 19 section 85.73 requires the workers' compensation commissioner
 12 20 to establish and maintain a registry of licensed physicians
 12 21 that offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries.
 12 22 The commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule,
 12 23 requirements for a physician to be listed on the registry and
 12 24 establish a registration fee.  The provision shall not be
 12 25 construed to require a physician to be listed on the registry
 12 26 in order to offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries
 12 27 or to prohibit an employer or employee from predesignating or
 12 28 designating a physician to provide treatment who is not listed
 12 29 on the registry.
 12 30    New Code section 85.74 requires the commissioner to
 12 31 establish and maintain a separate registry of licensed
 12 32 physicians trained to perform independent medical evaluations
 12 33 and to issue impairment ratings of injured employees.  The
 12 34 commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule, minimum
 12 35 training requirements for a physician to be listed on the
 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to
 13 10 retain the services of a medical director to assist the
 13 11 division of workers' compensation in advancing the field of
 13 12 occupational health in Iowa and to advise the commissioner on
 13 13 how to successfully apply and administer the state's workers'
 13 14 compensation laws.
 13 15    STATE WORKPLACE INJURY CARE PROVIDERS REGISTRY FUND.  All
 13 16 registration fees collected pursuant to new Code sections 85.73

 13 26    WORKERS' COMPENSATION ADVISORY COUNCIL.  New Code section
 13 27 85.78 establishes a workers' compensation advisory council

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.
 12 18    PROVIDER REGISTRIES ==== FEES ==== MEDICAL DIRECTOR.  New Code
 12 19 section 85.73 requires the workers' compensation commissioner
 12 20 to establish and maintain a registry of licensed physicians
 12 21 that offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries.
 12 22 The commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule,
 12 23 requirements for a physician to be listed on the registry and
 12 24 establish a registration fee.  The provision shall not be
 12 25 construed to require a physician to be listed on the registry
 12 26 in order to offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries
 12 27 or to prohibit an employer or employee from predesignating or
 12 28 designating a physician to provide treatment who is not listed
 12 29 on the registry.
 12 30    New Code section 85.74 requires the commissioner to
 12 31 establish and maintain a separate registry of licensed
 12 32 physicians trained to perform independent medical evaluations
 12 33 and to issue impairment ratings of injured employees.  The
 12 34 commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule, minimum
 12 35 training requirements for a physician to be listed on the
 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to
 13 10 retain the services of a medical director to assist the
 13 11 division of workers' compensation in advancing the field of
 13 12 occupational health in Iowa and to advise the commissioner on
 13 13 how to successfully apply and administer the state's workers'
 13 14 compensation laws.

 13 24 compensation advisory council created in new Code section
 13 25 85.78.
 13 26    WORKERS' COMPENSATION ADVISORY COUNCIL.  New Code section
 13 27 85.78 establishes a workers' compensation advisory council

 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.
 12 18    PROVIDER REGISTRIES ==== FEES ==== MEDICAL DIRECTOR.  New Code
 12 19 section 85.73 requires the workers' compensation commissioner
 12 20 to establish and maintain a registry of licensed physicians
 12 21 that offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries.
 12 22 The commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule,
 12 23 requirements for a physician to be listed on the registry and
 12 24 establish a registration fee.  The provision shall not be
 12 25 construed to require a physician to be listed on the registry
 12 26 in order to offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries
 12 27 or to prohibit an employer or employee from predesignating or
 12 28 designating a physician to provide treatment who is not listed
 12 29 on the registry.
 12 30    New Code section 85.74 requires the commissioner to
 12 31 establish and maintain a separate registry of licensed
 12 32 physicians trained to perform independent medical evaluations
 12 33 and to issue impairment ratings of injured employees.  The
 12 34 commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule, minimum
 12 35 training requirements for a physician to be listed on the
 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to
 13 10 retain the services of a medical director to assist the
 13 11 division of workers' compensation in advancing the field of
 13 12 occupational health in Iowa and to advise the commissioner on
 13 13 how to successfully apply and administer the state's workers'
 13 14 compensation laws.

 13 16 registration fees collected pursuant to new Code sections 85.73
 13 17 and 85.74 shall be credited to the state workplace injury care
 13 18 providers registry fund created in new Code section 85.77 and
 13 19 are appropriated to the division of workers' compensation by
 13 20 new Code section 85.75 to carry out the provisions of new Code

 13 24 compensation advisory council created in new Code section
 13 25 85.78.

 13 27 85.78 establishes a workers' compensation advisory council

 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical

 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The

 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a

 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with

 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the

 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for

 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of

 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 12 26 in order to offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries
 12 27 or to prohibit an employer or employee from predesignating or
 12 28 designating a physician to provide treatment who is not listed
 12 29 on the registry.

 12 34 commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule, minimum
 12 35 training requirements for a physician to be listed on the
 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.

 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to

 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed

 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to

 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American

 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify

 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for

 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of

 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to
 13 10 retain the services of a medical director to assist the
 13 11 division of workers' compensation in advancing the field of
 13 12 occupational health in Iowa and to advise the commissioner on
 13 13 how to successfully apply and administer the state's workers'

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to
 13 10 retain the services of a medical director to assist the
 13 11 division of workers' compensation in advancing the field of
 13 12 occupational health in Iowa and to advise the commissioner on
 13 13 how to successfully apply and administer the state's workers'

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to
 13 10 retain the services of a medical director to assist the
 13 11 division of workers' compensation in advancing the field of
 13 12 occupational health in Iowa and to advise the commissioner on
 13 13 how to successfully apply and administer the state's workers'

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to
 13 10 retain the services of a medical director to assist the
 13 11 division of workers' compensation in advancing the field of
 13 12 occupational health in Iowa and to advise the commissioner on
 13 13 how to successfully apply and administer the state's workers'

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to

 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 12 22 The commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule,
 12 23 requirements for a physician to be listed on the registry and
 12 24 establish a registration fee.  The provision shall not be
 12 25 construed to require a physician to be listed on the registry
 12 26 in order to offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries
 12 27 or to prohibit an employer or employee from predesignating or
 12 28 designating a physician to provide treatment who is not listed
 12 29 on the registry.
 12 30    New Code section 85.74 requires the commissioner to
 12 31 establish and maintain a separate registry of licensed
 12 32 physicians trained to perform independent medical evaluations
 12 33 and to issue impairment ratings of injured employees.  The
 12 34 commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule, minimum
 12 35 training requirements for a physician to be listed on the
 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees

 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.
 12 18    PROVIDER REGISTRIES ==== FEES ==== MEDICAL DIRECTOR.  New Code

 12 23 requirements for a physician to be listed on the registry and
 12 24 establish a registration fee.  The provision shall not be

 12 26 in order to offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries
 12 27 or to prohibit an employer or employee from predesignating or
 12 28 designating a physician to provide treatment who is not listed

 12 34 commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule, minimum
 12 35 training requirements for a physician to be listed on the
 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to
 13 10 retain the services of a medical director to assist the
 13 11 division of workers' compensation in advancing the field of

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.

 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for

 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for

 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of

 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 12 34 commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule, minimum
 12 35 training requirements for a physician to be listed on the
 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or

 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.

 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical

 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification

 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.
 12 18    PROVIDER REGISTRIES ==== FEES ==== MEDICAL DIRECTOR.  New Code
 12 19 section 85.73 requires the workers' compensation commissioner
 12 20 to establish and maintain a registry of licensed physicians
 12 21 that offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries.
 12 22 The commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule,
 12 23 requirements for a physician to be listed on the registry and
 12 24 establish a registration fee.  The provision shall not be
 12 25 construed to require a physician to be listed on the registry
 12 26 in order to offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries
 12 27 or to prohibit an employer or employee from predesignating or
 12 28 designating a physician to provide treatment who is not listed
 12 29 on the registry.
 12 30    New Code section 85.74 requires the commissioner to
 12 31 establish and maintain a separate registry of licensed
 12 32 physicians trained to perform independent medical evaluations
 12 33 and to issue impairment ratings of injured employees.  The
 12 34 commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule, minimum
 12 35 training requirements for a physician to be listed on the
 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to
 13 10 retain the services of a medical director to assist the
 13 11 division of workers' compensation in advancing the field of
 13 12 occupational health in Iowa and to advise the commissioner on
 13 13 how to successfully apply and administer the state's workers'
 13 14 compensation laws.

 13 24 compensation advisory council created in new Code section
 13 25 85.78.
 13 26    WORKERS' COMPENSATION ADVISORY COUNCIL.  New Code section
 13 27 85.78 establishes a workers' compensation advisory council

 13 30 representing organized labor.  The governor appoints two of the
 13 31 members, the majority leader and the minority leader of the
 13 32 senate jointly appoint two members, and the speaker and the

 14  1 commissioner in the successful administration of the division

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.
 12 18    PROVIDER REGISTRIES ==== FEES ==== MEDICAL DIRECTOR.  New Code
 12 19 section 85.73 requires the workers' compensation commissioner
 12 20 to establish and maintain a registry of licensed physicians
 12 21 that offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries.
 12 22 The commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule,
 12 23 requirements for a physician to be listed on the registry and
 12 24 establish a registration fee.  The provision shall not be
 12 25 construed to require a physician to be listed on the registry
 12 26 in order to offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries
 12 27 or to prohibit an employer or employee from predesignating or
 12 28 designating a physician to provide treatment who is not listed
 12 29 on the registry.
 12 30    New Code section 85.74 requires the commissioner to
 12 31 establish and maintain a separate registry of licensed
 12 32 physicians trained to perform independent medical evaluations
 12 33 and to issue impairment ratings of injured employees.  The
 12 34 commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule, minimum
 12 35 training requirements for a physician to be listed on the
 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to
 13 10 retain the services of a medical director to assist the
 13 11 division of workers' compensation in advancing the field of
 13 12 occupational health in Iowa and to advise the commissioner on
 13 13 how to successfully apply and administer the state's workers'

 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical

 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.
 12 18    PROVIDER REGISTRIES ==== FEES ==== MEDICAL DIRECTOR.  New Code
 12 19 section 85.73 requires the workers' compensation commissioner
 12 20 to establish and maintain a registry of licensed physicians
 12 21 that offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries.
 12 22 The commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule,
 12 23 requirements for a physician to be listed on the registry and
 12 24 establish a registration fee.  The provision shall not be
 12 25 construed to require a physician to be listed on the registry
 12 26 in order to offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries
 12 27 or to prohibit an employer or employee from predesignating or
 12 28 designating a physician to provide treatment who is not listed
 12 29 on the registry.
 12 30    New Code section 85.74 requires the commissioner to
 12 31 establish and maintain a separate registry of licensed
 12 32 physicians trained to perform independent medical evaluations
 12 33 and to issue impairment ratings of injured employees.  The
 12 34 commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule, minimum
 12 35 training requirements for a physician to be listed on the
 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to
 13 10 retain the services of a medical director to assist the
 13 11 division of workers' compensation in advancing the field of
 13 12 occupational health in Iowa and to advise the commissioner on
 13 13 how to successfully apply and administer the state's workers'
 13 14 compensation laws.
 13 15    STATE WORKPLACE INJURY CARE PROVIDERS REGISTRY FUND.  All
 13 16 registration fees collected pursuant to new Code sections 85.73
 13 17 and 85.74 shall be credited to the state workplace injury care

 13 19 are appropriated to the division of workers' compensation by
 13 20 new Code section 85.75 to carry out the provisions of new Code

 13 24 compensation advisory council created in new Code section
 13 25 85.78.
 13 26    WORKERS' COMPENSATION ADVISORY COUNCIL.  New Code section
 13 27 85.78 establishes a workers' compensation advisory council

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.
 12 18    PROVIDER REGISTRIES ==== FEES ==== MEDICAL DIRECTOR.  New Code
 12 19 section 85.73 requires the workers' compensation commissioner
 12 20 to establish and maintain a registry of licensed physicians
 12 21 that offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries.

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 12 22 The commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule,
 12 23 requirements for a physician to be listed on the registry and

 12 26 in order to offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries

 12 34 commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule, minimum
 12 35 training requirements for a physician to be listed on the
 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.
 12 18    PROVIDER REGISTRIES ==== FEES ==== MEDICAL DIRECTOR.  New Code
 12 19 section 85.73 requires the workers' compensation commissioner
 12 20 to establish and maintain a registry of licensed physicians
 12 21 that offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries.
 12 22 The commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule,
 12 23 requirements for a physician to be listed on the registry and
 12 24 establish a registration fee.  The provision shall not be
 12 25 construed to require a physician to be listed on the registry
 12 26 in order to offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries
 12 27 or to prohibit an employer or employee from predesignating or
 12 28 designating a physician to provide treatment who is not listed
 12 29 on the registry.
 12 30    New Code section 85.74 requires the commissioner to

 12 33 and to issue impairment ratings of injured employees.  The
 12 34 commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule, minimum
 12 35 training requirements for a physician to be listed on the
 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to
 13 10 retain the services of a medical director to assist the
 13 11 division of workers' compensation in advancing the field of
 13 12 occupational health in Iowa and to advise the commissioner on
 13 13 how to successfully apply and administer the state's workers'
 13 14 compensation laws.

 13 24 compensation advisory council created in new Code section
 13 25 85.78.
 13 26    WORKERS' COMPENSATION ADVISORY COUNCIL.  New Code section
 13 27 85.78 establishes a workers' compensation advisory council
 13 28 within the division of workers' compensation that is composed
 13 29 of six members, three representing employers and three
 13 30 representing organized labor.  The governor appoints two of the
 13 31 members, the majority leader and the minority leader of the
 13 32 senate jointly appoint two members, and the speaker and the
 13 33 minority leader of the house of representatives jointly appoint
 13 34 two members.  The members serve six=year staggered terms.  The
 13 35 purpose of the council is to assist the workers' compensation
 14  1 commissioner in the successful administration of the division

 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 12 23 requirements for a physician to be listed on the registry and

 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.

 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical

 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated

 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American

 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the

 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for

 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,

 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for

 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for

 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.
 12 18    PROVIDER REGISTRIES ==== FEES ==== MEDICAL DIRECTOR.  New Code
 12 19 section 85.73 requires the workers' compensation commissioner
 12 20 to establish and maintain a registry of licensed physicians
 12 21 that offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries.
 12 22 The commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule,
 12 23 requirements for a physician to be listed on the registry and
 12 24 establish a registration fee.  The provision shall not be
 12 25 construed to require a physician to be listed on the registry
 12 26 in order to offer or provide treatment of work=related injuries
 12 27 or to prohibit an employer or employee from predesignating or
 12 28 designating a physician to provide treatment who is not listed
 12 29 on the registry.
 12 30    New Code section 85.74 requires the commissioner to

 12 34 commissioner shall establish, by administrative rule, minimum
 12 35 training requirements for a physician to be listed on the
 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to
 13 10 retain the services of a medical director to assist the
 13 11 division of workers' compensation in advancing the field of
 13 12 occupational health in Iowa and to advise the commissioner on
 13 13 how to successfully apply and administer the state's workers'
 13 14 compensation laws.

 13 24 compensation advisory council created in new Code section
 13 25 85.78.
 13 26    WORKERS' COMPENSATION ADVISORY COUNCIL.  New Code section
 13 27 85.78 establishes a workers' compensation advisory council

 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  1 registry and establish a fee.  A physician must be listed
 13  2 on the registry in order to perform independent medical
 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.
 13  9    New Code section 85.76 authorizes the commissioner to
 13 10 retain the services of a medical director to assist the
 13 11 division of workers' compensation in advancing the field of
 13 12 occupational health in Iowa and to advise the commissioner on
 13 13 how to successfully apply and administer the state's workers'
 13 14 compensation laws.

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 10  1                           EXPLANATION
 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 13  3 evaluations and issue impairment ratings of injured employees
 13  4 in this state.  The commissioner may prohibit an employer
 13  5 or employee from using an independent medical evaluation or
 13  6 impairment rating of an injured employee from a physician who
 13  7 is not listed on the registry as evidence at a hearing to
 13  8 determine benefits under Iowa's workers' compensation laws.

 10  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10  4    This bill relates to the state's workers' compensation laws
 10  5 by modifying alternate care procedures for medical treatment,
 10  6 creating registries of physicians who treat and evaluate
 10  7 work=related injuries, providing for the retention of a medical
 10  8 director, creating a state workplace injury care providers
 10  9 registry fund, establishing a workers' compensation advisory
 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's
 12 16 choosing at the employer's expense, including transportation
 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.

 10 10 council, providing for fees, and providing effective dates.
 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of

 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace

 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for

 10 11    ALTERNATE CARE.  Amended Code section 85.27(4), concerning
 10 12 the provision of medical services, requires an employer
 10 13 to provide written information about the state's workers'
 10 14 compensation laws to an employee upon receiving notification
 10 15 that the employee has suffered a work=related injury.  The
 10 16 employer has the right to predesignate a licensed physician
 10 17 to treat the injury and make necessary referrals and may
 10 18 predesignate a physician listed on the state registry of
 10 19 workplace injury care providers.  If the employer does not
 10 20 predesignate a treating physician, the employee may designate a
 10 21 physician of the employee's choosing to provide the treatment.
 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace

 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of

 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with

 10 22 Currently, an employer has the right to choose care for
 10 23 workplace injuries and an employee does not have the right
 10 24 to designate a physician to provide treatment for workplace
 10 25 injuries, whether or not the employer has predesignated a
 10 26 treating physician, except in certain emergency situations.
 10 27    The physician predesignated by the employer or designated
 10 28 by the employee is required to provide ongoing written
 10 29 documentation of the physician's opinions, treatment
 10 30 recommendations, and care plan to the employee along with
 10 31 information about whether the opinions, recommendations, and
 10 32 care plan are in accord with either the official disability
 10 33 guidelines and treatment guidelines in workers' compensation
 10 34 published by the work loss data institute or the American
 10 35 college of occupational and environmental medicine practice
 11  1 guidelines (ACOEM), and if so, citation to the appropriate
 11  2 guidelines.  The employee has the right to request and obtain
 11  3 a second opinion from another licensed physician of the
 11  4 employee's choosing at the employer's expense.
 11  5    If the employer or employee is dissatisfied with the care
 11  6 of a treating physician predesignated or designated by the
 11  7 other party or with any referral made by that physician, the
 11  8 employer and employee may mutually agree to alternate care.  If
 11  9 they cannot agree on alternate care, either party may notify
 11 10 an insurance claims specialist within the division of workers'
 11 11 compensation, who shall, within five working days, schedule
 11 12 a conference between the parties to review the basis for
 11 13 dissatisfaction and provide an advisory opinion to resolve the
 11 14 dispute.  If the parties still cannot agree on alternate care
 11 15 after this conference, the workers' compensation commissioner,
 11 16 upon application and reasonable proof of the necessity, may
 11 17 allow and order alternate care.
 11 18    The employee is responsible to make the application for
 11 19 alternate care and to provide such reasonable proof to the
 11 20 commissioner if the employer provided written information
 11 21 about the state's workers' compensation laws at the time of
 11 22 notification of the employee's injury, and predesignated a
 11 23 treating physician listed on the state registry of workplace
 11 24 injury care providers, and if the treating physician
 11 25 predesignated by the employer provided written documentation
 11 26 to the employee of the physician's opinions, treatment
 11 27 recommendations, and care plan along with citation to the
 11 28 appropriate treatment guidelines.
 11 29    The employer is responsible for making the application for
 11 30 alternate care and providing reasonable proof if the employer
 11 31 and predesignated treating physician did not act as described
 11 32 above or if the employee designated the treating physician to
 11 33 treat the work injury.
 11 34    The commissioner is not bound by the advisory opinion of
 11 35 the claims specialist and must conduct a hearing and issue
 12  1 a decision within 10 days of receipt of an application for
 12  2 alternate care.
 12  3    The employer has the right to request an employee to submit,
 12  4 as often as is reasonable and at a reasonable time and place
 12  5 to an examination by a licensed physician chosen by the
 12  6 employer for any purpose relevant to the employer's duties to
 12  7 provide benefits to the employee under the state's workers'
 12  8 compensation laws and at the employer's expense.  If the
 12  9 employer makes the request in writing and pays all expenses,
 12 10 including transportation, the employee shall submit to the
 12 11 examination.  Each time that the employer obtains an evaluation
 12 12 of an employee's permanent disability by a physician chosen by
 12 13 the employer, if the employee believes that the evaluation of
 12 14 disability is too low, the employee may obtain a subsequent
 12 15 examination and evaluation by a physician of the employee's

 12 17 expenses to and from the place of the examination.
