  2  8 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2  9 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 10    Under current law, Code section 321.1 provides that a
  2 11 motorcycle is a motor vehicle having a saddle or seat for the
  2 12 use of the rider and designed to travel on not more than three
  2 13 wheels in contact with the ground. The term "motorcycle"
  2 14 includes motor scooters and excludes tractors, autocycles, and
  2 15 motorized bicycles. The term "motor scooter" is not defined
  2 16 in Code chapter 321. Code section 321.189 provides that a
  2 17 class C driver's license is valid for, among other things, the
  2 18 operation of vehicles, other than motorcycles, that weigh less
  2 19 than 26,001 pounds and vehicles, other than motorcycles, for
  2 20 which the operator is exempt from commercial driver's license
  2 21 requirements.
  2 22    This bill defines "motor scooter" to mean a motor vehicle
  2 23 having a saddle or seat for the use of the rider, designed
  2 24 to travel on not more than three wheels in contact with the
  2 25 ground, equipped with an engine no greater than 150 cubic
  2 26 centimeters in size, and capable of operating at a speed in
  2 27 excess of 39 miles per hour on level ground unassisted by
  2 28 human power. The bill does not remove "motor scooter" from
  2 29 the definition of "motorcycle", but provides that a class C
  2 30 driver's license is valid for the operation of a motor scooter
  2 31 if the holder of the driver's license is 22 years of age or
  2 32 older. The bill also exempts class C driver's licenses valid
  2 33 for the operation of a motor scooter from the fee added to
  2 34 driver's licenses valid for the operation of a motorcycle
  2 35 fordeposit in the motorcycle rider education fund.
  3  1 The bill does not otherwise alter any requirements or
  3  2 limitations applicable to motorcycles, and therefore to motor
  3  3 scooters, under current law. These include but are not limited
  3  4 to the requirement that the registration plate issued for a
  3  5 motorcycle be attached to the rear of the motorcycle (Code
  3  6 section 321.37), the imposition of the $20 annual registration
  3  7 fee for motorcycles (Code section 321.117), the prohibition
  3  8 against operating or riding a motorcycle on the highways
  3  9 with another person on the motorcycle unless the motorcycle
  3 10 is designed to carry more than one person (Code section
  3 11 321.275), and the requirement that motorcycles be equipped with
  3 12 at least one and not more than two headlamps (Code section
  3 13 321.386). Under the bill, a person is still required to obtain
  3 14 a motorcycle instruction permit or class M driver's license
  3 15 to operate a motorcycle if the operator is 21 years of age or
  3 16 younger, or to operate a motorcycle other than a motor scooter
  3 17 if the operator is 22 years of age or older (Code sections
  3 18 321.180, 321.180B, and 321.189).
