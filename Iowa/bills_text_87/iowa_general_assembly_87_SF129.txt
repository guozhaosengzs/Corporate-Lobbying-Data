  1 16 stewardship and under federal law as enforced by the United
  1 17 States department of agriculture.  The conclusion must at least
  1 18 be based on clinical indications that if true could reasonably
  1 19 constitute elements of animal abuse in the first degree as
  1 20 described in section 717B.2, subsection 1, animal neglect in

 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 35 witnessed the offense being committed.
 21  1 STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 21  2 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  3 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  4 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  5 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  6 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  7 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 20                           EXPLANATION
 17 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 30 481A.42).
 17 31    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 32 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 33 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 34 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 35 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 35 witnessed the offense being committed.
 21  1 STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 21  2 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  3 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  4 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  5 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  6 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to

 17 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 30 481A.42).
 17 31    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 32 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 33 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 34 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 35 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 17 20                           EXPLANATION
 17 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 30 481A.42).
 17 31    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 32 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 33 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 34 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 35 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 35 witnessed the offense being committed.
 21  1 STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 21  2 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  3 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  4 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  5 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  6 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  7 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 30 481A.42).
 17 31    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 32 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 33 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 34 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 35 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or

 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be

 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,

 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 35 witnessed the offense being committed.
 21  1 STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 21  2 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  3 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  4 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  5 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  6 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  7 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 30 481A.42).
 17 31    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 32 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 33 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 34 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 35 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail

 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class

 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order

 17 20                           EXPLANATION
 17 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 30 481A.42).
 17 31    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 32 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 33 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 34 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 35 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 35 witnessed the offense being committed.
 21  1 STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 21  2 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  3 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  4 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  5 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  6 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  7 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 30 481A.42).
 17 31    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 32 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 33 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 34 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 35 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended

 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog

 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or

 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For

 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct

 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)

 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation

 17 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 30 481A.42).
 17 31    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 32 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 33 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 34 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 35 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also

 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing

 17 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 30 481A.42).
 17 31    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 32 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 33 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 34 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 35 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 35 witnessed the offense being committed.
 21  1 STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 21  2 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  3 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  4 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  5 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  6 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  7 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 30 481A.42).
 17 31    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 32 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 33 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 34 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 35 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.

 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 35 witnessed the offense being committed.

 17 21 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 17 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 30 481A.42).
 17 31    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 32 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 33 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 34 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 35 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each

 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.

 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 35 witnessed the offense being committed.
 21  1 STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 21  2 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  3 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  4 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  5 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  6 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  7 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 30 481A.42).
 17 31    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 32 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 33 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 34 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 35 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.

 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 35 witnessed the offense being committed.
 21  1 STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 21  2 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  3 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  4 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  5 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  6 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  7 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 22 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 17 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 30 481A.42).
 17 31    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 32 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 33 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 34 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 35 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For

 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.

 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill

 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 35 witnessed the offense being committed.
 21  1 STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 21  2 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  3 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  4 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  5 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  6 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  7 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 17 23    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 17 24 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 17 25 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 17 26 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 17 27 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 17 28 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 17 29 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 17 30 481A.42).
 17 31    There are seven amended or new criminal offenses, including
 17 32 animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended Code
 17 33 section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), animal neglect
 17 34 in the first or second degree (new Code section 717B.2B
 17 35 and amended Code section 717B.3), animal torture (amended
 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the

 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.

 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the

 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also

 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two

 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 35 witnessed the offense being committed.

 21  4 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  5 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  6 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to

 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has

 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)

 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"

 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 35 witnessed the offense being committed.
 21  1 STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 21  2 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  3 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  4 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  5 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or

 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect

 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that

 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 35 witnessed the offense being committed.
 21  1 STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 21  2 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  3 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  4 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  5 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  6 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  7 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:

 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or

 18  1 Code section 717B.3A), animal abandonment (new Code section
 18  2 717B.3B), and animal endangerment (new Code section 717B.3C).
 18  3  Each of the amended or new offenses includes an enhanced
 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 35 witnessed the offense being committed.
 21  1 STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 21  2 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  3 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  4 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  5 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  6 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  7 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect

 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct

 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly

 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more

 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two

 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 20 24 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 20 25 to animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture.  The board
 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 20 33 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 20 34 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 20 35 witnessed the offense being committed.
 21  1 STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 21  2 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 21  3 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 21  4 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 21  5 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 21  6 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 21  7 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 18  4 penalty that applies to a convicted person in either of two
 18  5 situations:  (1) the person is an adult who committed the
 18  6 offense in the presence of a juvenile or (2) the person has
 18  7 previously committed any of the offenses previously described;
 18  8 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 18  9 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 18 10 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 18 11 section 717D.4); or committed any similar offense in another
 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary

 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.

 18 12 state.
 18 13    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, NEGLECT, OR TORTURE.
 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse
 18 30 in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be
 18 31 enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; (3) animal neglect
 18 32 in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor which may be
 18 33 enhanced to a class "D" felony; (4)  animal neglect in the
 18 34 second degree, a serious misdemeanor which may be enhanced to
 18 35 an aggravated misdemeanor; and (5) animal torture, a class "D"
 19  1 felony which may be enhanced to a class "C" felony.
 19  2    A number of exceptions apply to the animal abuse and animal
 19  3 torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court order; (2)
 19  4 a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry practice;
 19  5 (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting, trapping,
 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that
 19  9 excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 19 10 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 19 11 sadistic or depraved intent.
 19 12    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ANIMAL ABANDONMENT AND ANIMAL
 19 13 ENDANGERMENT.  For animal abandonment, a person must knowingly
 19 14 or recklessly relinquish custody of an animal, and then fail
 19 15 to provide for its legal transfer or make arrangements for its
 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 19 22 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 19 23 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 19 24 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 19 25 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 19 26 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 19 27 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 19 28 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 19 29 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 19 30 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 19 31 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 19 32    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 20  4 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 20  9 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 20 10 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 20 11 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 20 12 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 20 13 felony.
 20 14    ANIMAL RESCUE ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.  A law
 20 15 enforcement officer (e.g., county sheriff or deputy sheriff)
 20 16 is authorized to rescue an animal from a motor vehicle based
 20 17 upon the officer's reasonable belief that the animal may be
 20 18 suffering distress.  The officer must provide a written notice
 20 19 of the rescue.  After the rescue, the animal must be maintained
 20 20 as a rescued animal by the local authority until it is claimed
 20 21 or disposed of pursuant to court order.
 20 22    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 20 23 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report

 20 26 of veterinary medicine may prescribe the form of the report.
 20 27 The report must be submitted to the local law enforcement
 20 28 agency  having jurisdiction of the matter.
 20 29    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 20 30 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 20 31 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 20 32 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving

 18 14 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 18 15 poisoning; animal neglect involves failing to provide an animal
 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor
 18 29 which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2) animal abuse

 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which
 19 20 may be enhanced to a serious misdemeanor.
 19 21    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are

 18 16 with adequate food, water, habitable conditions, or necessary
 18 17 veterinary care; and animal torture involves inflicting upon
 18 18 the animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 18 19 animal abuse in the first degree, animal neglect in the first
 18 20 degree, or animal torture, the animal must suffer a serious
 18 21 injury or death. Serious injury involves a substantial risk
 18 22 of death, protracted disfigurement, impairment, or a loss or
 18 23 impairment of a limb. For animal abuse in the second degree,
 18 24 the animal must suffer an injury meaning some impairment to the
 18 25 animal's health or functions, or death. For animal neglect in
 18 26 the second degree, the injury element is not required. For
 18 27 these offenses, the criminal penalties are as follows:  (1)
 18 28 animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated misdemeanor

 19  6 or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7) conduct
 19  7 by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The bill
 19  8 eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section that

 19 16 care. For animal endangerment, a person must confine an animal
 19 17 in a stationary motor vehicle in a manner that endangers the
 19 18 health or life of the animal. For these last two offenses, the
 19 19 criminal penalties are the same: a simple misdemeanor which

 19 33 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 19 34 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 19 35 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 20  1 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 20  2 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 20  3 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary

 20  5 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 20  6 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 20  7 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 20  8 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
