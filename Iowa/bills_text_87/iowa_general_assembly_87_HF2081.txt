  5 12 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 13 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 14 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 15 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 16 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 17 12=month period.
  5 18    BACKGROUND ==== MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 19 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 20 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 21 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 22 use manure management practices in a manner that exceeds
  5 23 specific state law requirements.  The master matrix includes
  5 24 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  5 25 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  5 26 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  5 27 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  5 28 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  5 29 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  5 30 the department of natural resources (Code section 459.304),
  5 31 which decides whether to approve or disapprove the application
  5 32 (Code section 459.303).  A county is statutorily preempted
  5 33 from approving, denying, or imposing conditions upon the
  5 34 construction of a confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 35 the management of manure originating from the operation (Code
  6  1 section 331.304A).

  5 10    BACKGROUND ==== TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 11 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 12 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 13 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 14 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 15 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 16 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 17 12=month period.
  5 18    BACKGROUND ==== MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 19 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 20 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 21 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 22 use manure management practices in a manner that exceeds
  5 23 specific state law requirements.  The master matrix includes
  5 24 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  5 25 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  5 26 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  5 27 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  5 28 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  5 29 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  5 30 the department of natural resources (Code section 459.304),
  5 31 which decides whether to approve or disapprove the application
  5 32 (Code section 459.303).  A county is statutorily preempted
  5 33 from approving, denying, or imposing conditions upon the
  5 34 construction of a confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 35 the management of manure originating from the operation (Code
  6  1 section 331.304A).

  5 20 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 21 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 22 use manure management practices in a manner that exceeds
  5 23 specific state law requirements.  The master matrix includes
  5 24 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  5 25 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  5 26 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  5 27 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  5 28 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  5 29 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  5 30 the department of natural resources (Code section 459.304),

  5 10    BACKGROUND ==== TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 11 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 12 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 13 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 14 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 15 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 16 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 17 12=month period.
  5 18    BACKGROUND ==== MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 19 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 20 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 21 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 22 use manure management practices in a manner that exceeds
  5 23 specific state law requirements.  The master matrix includes
  5 24 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  5 25 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  5 26 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  5 27 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  5 28 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  5 29 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  5 30 the department of natural resources (Code section 459.304),
  5 31 which decides whether to approve or disapprove the application
  5 32 (Code section 459.303).  A county is statutorily preempted
  5 33 from approving, denying, or imposing conditions upon the
  5 34 construction of a confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 35 the management of manure originating from the operation (Code
  6  1 section 331.304A).

  5 10    BACKGROUND ==== TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 11 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 12 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 13 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 14 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 15 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 16 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 17 12=month period.
  5 18    BACKGROUND ==== MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 19 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 20 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 21 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 22 use manure management practices in a manner that exceeds
  5 23 specific state law requirements.  The master matrix includes
  5 24 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  5 25 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  5 26 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  5 27 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  5 28 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  5 29 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  5 30 the department of natural resources (Code section 459.304),
  5 31 which decides whether to approve or disapprove the application
  5 32 (Code section 459.303).  A county is statutorily preempted
  5 33 from approving, denying, or imposing conditions upon the
  5 34 construction of a confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 35 the management of manure originating from the operation (Code
  6  1 section 331.304A).

  5 18    BACKGROUND ==== MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 19 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 20 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 21 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 22 use manure management practices in a manner that exceeds
  5 23 specific state law requirements.  The master matrix includes
  5 24 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  5 25 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  5 26 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  5 27 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  5 28 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  5 29 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  5 30 the department of natural resources (Code section 459.304),
  5 31 which decides whether to approve or disapprove the application
  5 32 (Code section 459.303).  A county is statutorily preempted
  5 33 from approving, denying, or imposing conditions upon the
  5 34 construction of a confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 35 the management of manure originating from the operation (Code

  5 22 use manure management practices in a manner that exceeds
  5 23 specific state law requirements.  The master matrix includes
  5 24 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  5 25 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  5 26 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  5 27 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  5 28 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  5 29 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  5 30 the department of natural resources (Code section 459.304),
  5 31 which decides whether to approve or disapprove the application
  5 32 (Code section 459.303).  A county is statutorily preempted
  5 33 from approving, denying, or imposing conditions upon the
  5 34 construction of a confinement feeding operation structure or

  5 10    BACKGROUND ==== TERMS.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 11 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 12 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 13 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 14 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 15 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 16 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 17 12=month period.
  5 18    BACKGROUND ==== MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 19 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 20 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 21 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 22 use manure management practices in a manner that exceeds
  5 23 specific state law requirements.  The master matrix includes
  5 24 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  5 25 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  5 26 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  5 27 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  5 28 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  5 29 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  5 30 the department of natural resources (Code section 459.304),
  5 31 which decides whether to approve or disapprove the application
  5 32 (Code section 459.303).  A county is statutorily preempted
  5 33 from approving, denying, or imposing conditions upon the
  5 34 construction of a confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 35 the management of manure originating from the operation (Code

  5 11 structure is a type of animal feeding operation that includes
  5 12 a building to house agricultural animals and a structure used
  5 13 to store manure or in the case of layer operations a structure
  5 14 used to store washwater.  A confinement feeding operation
  5 15 refers to a place where agricultural animals are confined and
  5 16 fed in totally roofed buildings for 45 days or more in any
  5 17 12=month period.
  5 18    BACKGROUND ==== MASTER MATRIX.  The master matrix refers
  5 19 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 20 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 21 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 22 use manure management practices in a manner that exceeds
  5 23 specific state law requirements.  The master matrix includes
  5 24 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  5 25 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  5 26 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  5 27 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  5 28 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  5 29 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  5 30 the department of natural resources (Code section 459.304),
  5 31 which decides whether to approve or disapprove the application
  5 32 (Code section 459.303).  A county is statutorily preempted
  5 33 from approving, denying, or imposing conditions upon the
  5 34 construction of a confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 35 the management of manure originating from the operation (Code
  6  1 section 331.304A).

  5 19 to a form completed by a person applying for a construction
  5 20 permit.  The applicant is awarded points based on an agreement
  5 21 to construct the confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 22 use manure management practices in a manner that exceeds
  5 23 specific state law requirements.  The master matrix includes
  5 24 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  5 25 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  5 26 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  5 27 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  5 28 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  5 29 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  5 30 the department of natural resources (Code section 459.304),
  5 31 which decides whether to approve or disapprove the application
  5 32 (Code section 459.303).  A county is statutorily preempted
  5 33 from approving, denying, or imposing conditions upon the
  5 34 construction of a confinement feeding operation structure or
  5 35 the management of manure originating from the operation (Code

  5 22 use manure management practices in a manner that exceeds
  5 23 specific state law requirements.  The master matrix includes
  5 24 three subcategories which value impacts on air, water, and
  5 25 community.  An applicant must obtain a minimum overall score
  5 26 of 440 out of 880 points and a score of 25 percent of available
  5 27 points in each of the three subcategories.  A county board of
  5 28 supervisors which adopts a construction evaluation resolution
  5 29 may evaluate the application and matrix and submit comments to
  5 30 the department of natural resources (Code section 459.304),
  5 31 which decides whether to approve or disapprove the application
  5 32 (Code section 459.303).  A county is statutorily preempted
  5 33 from approving, denying, or imposing conditions upon the
