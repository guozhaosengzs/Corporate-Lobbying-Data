  4  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  8    This bill relates to the workforce housing tax incentives
  4  9 program by increasing the maximum dollar amount that may be
  4 10 allocated to the program, by requiring that a certain dollar
  4 11 value of tax credits be allocated to housing projects in small
  4 12 cities, and by increasing the percentage for computing tax
  4 13 credits for such housing projects.
  4 14    The bill raises the annual allowable tax credits allocation
  4 15 under the program from $20 million to $30 million, but
  4 16 maintains the economic development authority's (authority)
  4 17 $170 million aggregate tax credit limit. The bill requires
  4 18 the authority to allocate at least $10 million in tax credits
  4 19 to housing projects in small cities and to administer such
  4 20 reserved allocations separately. If the authority does not
  4 21 reach the $10 million for such projects in a fiscal year, the
  4 22 bill provides that the authority may issue tax incentives from
  4 23 the reserved allocation to registered housing projects that
  4 24 are not located in small cities. Under the bill, a small city
  4 25 includes any city or township not located in one of the 11
  4 26 most populous counties in the state, as determined by the most
  4 27 recent federal decennial census. Under the bill, a small city
  4 28 that is located in more than one county is considered to be
  4 29 located in the county having the greatest taxable base within
  4 30 the small city.
  4 31    The bill provides that a housing project in a small city
  4 32 that results in two or more new single=family dwelling units
  4 33 at a greenfield site, as defined in the bill, may receive tax
  4 34 incentives under the program, equaling up to 20 percent of the
  4 35 qualifying new investment.
  5  1 For the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2017, and ending
  5  2 June 30, 2022, the bill requires reductions in the authority's
  5  3 allowable allocations to the high quality jobs program
