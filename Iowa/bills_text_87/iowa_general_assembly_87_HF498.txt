  4  3                           EXPLANATION
  4  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  6    This bill establishes the Iowa center for suicide prevention
  4  7 in the department of education to provide, in a coordinated and
  4  8 comprehensive way, ongoing support to Iowa's schools relating
  4  9 to suicide prevention and trauma=informed care, in the form of
  4 10 information, resources, and evidence=based training content.
  4 11 The goal of the center is that every student, regardless
  4 12 of where they reside in the state, have access to the same
  4 13 high=quality suicide prevention, intervention, and support
  4 14 resources. The department may employ personnel necessary to
  4 15 carry out the duties of the center.
  4 16    The bill provides that the center has the initial
  4 17 responsibility of supporting schools with implementation of
  4 18 suicide prevention programs and development of trauma=informed
  4 19 learning environments, including adaptation of existing
  4 20 evidence=based suicide prevention and trauma=informed
  4 21 care training for school personnel and development of
  4 22 evidence=based model protocols to assist schools in suicide
  4 23 prevention and postvention. The bill also provides long=term
  4 24 responsibilities of the center, including adapting, reviewing,
  4 25 and improving evidence=based training on suicide prevention and
  4 26 trauma=informed care on an ongoing basis and supporting efforts
  4 27 by schools to provide suicide prevention and trauma=informed
  4 28 care for students.
  4 29    The bill appropriates $500,000 from the general fund of
  4 30 the state to the department for fiscal year 2017=2018 for the
  4 31 establishment and administration of the center.
  4 32    The bill requires the board of directors of a school
  4 33 district to integrate biennial, evidence=based training on
  4 34 suicide prevention for all school personnel who hold a license,
  4 35 certificate, authorization, or statement of recognition issued
  5  1 by the board of educational examiners and who have regular
  5  2 contact with students in grades six through 12 into the school
  5  3 district's comprehensive school improvement plan by July 1,
  5  4 2018. The content of the training shall be determined by the
  5  5 center.  The bill provides a similar requirement for training
  5  6 on trauma=informed care for school personnel who have regular
  5  7 contact with students in kindergarten through grade 12.
  5  8    The bill requires the state board of education to adopt rules
  5  9 to require school districts to adopt protocols for suicide
  5 10 prevention and postvention as developed by the center. The
  5 11 bill requires the board to submit a notice of intended action
  5 12 to begin such rulemaking no later than December 13, 2017, and
  5 13 to adopt such rules not later than July 1, 2018.
  5 14    The bill defines "trauma=informed care" as services that are
  5 15 based on an understanding of the vulnerabilities and triggers
  5 16 of individuals who have experienced trauma, recognize the role
  5 17 trauma has played in the lives of those individuals, recognize
  5 18 the presence of trauma symptoms and their onset, are supportive
  5 19 of trauma recovery, and avoid further traumatization. The bill
  5 20 defines "postvention" as the provision of crisis intervention,
  5 21 support, and assistance for those affected by a suicide or
  5 22 suicide attempt to prevent further risk of suicide.

  4  4 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  5 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  6    This bill establishes the Iowa center for suicide prevention
  4  7 in the department of education to provide, in a coordinated and
  4  8 comprehensive way, ongoing support to Iowa's schools relating
  4  9 to suicide prevention and trauma=informed care, in the form of
  4 10 information, resources, and evidence=based training content.
  4 11 The goal of the center is that every student, regardless
  4 12 of where they reside in the state, have access to the same
  4 13 high=quality suicide prevention, intervention, and support
  4 14 resources. The department may employ personnel necessary to
  4 15 carry out the duties of the center.
  4 16    The bill provides that the center has the initial
  4 17 responsibility of supporting schools with implementation of
  4 18 suicide prevention programs and development of trauma=informed
  4 19 learning environments, including adaptation of existing
  4 20 evidence=based suicide prevention and trauma=informed
  4 21 care training for school personnel and development of
  4 22 evidence=based model protocols to assist schools in suicide
  4 23 prevention and postvention. The bill also provides long=term
  4 24 responsibilities of the center, including adapting, reviewing,
  4 25 and improving evidence=based training on suicide prevention and
  4 26 trauma=informed care on an ongoing basis and supporting efforts
  4 27 by schools to provide suicide prevention and trauma=informed
  4 28 care for students.
  4 29    The bill appropriates $500,000 from the general fund of
  4 30 the state to the department for fiscal year 2017=2018 for the
  4 31 establishment and administration of the center.
  4 32    The bill requires the board of directors of a school
  4 33 district to integrate biennial, evidence=based training on
  4 34 suicide prevention for all school personnel who hold a license,
  4 35 certificate, authorization, or statement of recognition issued
  5  1 by the board of educational examiners and who have regular
  5  2 contact with students in grades six through 12 into the school
  5  3 district's comprehensive school improvement plan by July 1,
  5  4 2018. The content of the training shall be determined by the
  5  5 center.  The bill provides a similar requirement for training
  5  6 on trauma=informed care for school personnel who have regular
  5  7 contact with students in kindergarten through grade 12.
  5  8    The bill requires the state board of education to adopt rules
  5  9 to require school districts to adopt protocols for suicide
  5 10 prevention and postvention as developed by the center. The
  5 11 bill requires the board to submit a notice of intended action
  5 12 to begin such rulemaking no later than December 13, 2017, and
  5 13 to adopt such rules not later than July 1, 2018.
  5 14    The bill defines "trauma=informed care" as services that are
  5 15 based on an understanding of the vulnerabilities and triggers
  5 16 of individuals who have experienced trauma, recognize the role
  5 17 trauma has played in the lives of those individuals, recognize
  5 18 the presence of trauma symptoms and their onset, are supportive
  5 19 of trauma recovery, and avoid further traumatization. The bill
  5 20 defines "postvention" as the provision of crisis intervention,
  5 21 support, and assistance for those affected by a suicide or
  5 22 suicide attempt to prevent further risk of suicide.

  5 16 of individuals who have experienced trauma, recognize the role
  5 17 trauma has played in the lives of those individuals, recognize
