  5 13                           EXPLANATION
  5 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 16    This bill makes numerous changes to the Iowa first=time
  5 17 homebuyer savings account program in Code chapter 541B
  5 18 (program).
  5 19    The bill removes the requirement that a first=time homebuyer
  5 20 be a resident of Iowa.  The bill modifies the definition of
  5 21 "first=time homebuyer savings account" under the program to
  5 22 provide that the account must constitute a savings deposit
  5 23 as that term is defined for purposes of the federal reserve
  5 24 system.  The bill modifies the definition of "single=family
  5 25 residence" under the program to include a reference to the
  5 26 definition of "single=family residence" under the uniform
  5 27 residential landlord and tenant law (Code chapter 562A), and to
  5 28 require that the single=family residence be owned and occupied
  5 29 by the designated beneficiary within 90 days of the closing
  5 30 date.
  5 31    The bill strikes the ability of a married couple filing joint
  5 32 individual income tax returns to establish and maintain a joint
  5 33 first=time homebuyer savings account (account).
  5 34    The bill modifies various deadlines for filing forms and
  5 35 making designations under the program from April 30 of the year
  6  1 following the year the account is opened, to the last day of
  6  2 the fourth month after the expiration of the tax year during
  6  3 which the account is opened.
  6  4    The bill strikes the requirement that an annual report for
  6  5 an account be included with the account holder's Iowa income
  6  6 tax return, and further strikes a requirement that an account
  6  7 holder submit a copy of the federal internal revenue service
  6  8 form 1099 related to an account with the account holder's Iowa
  6  9 income tax return.
  6 10    Finally, the bill makes changes to the income tax benefits
  6 11 related to contributions to and earnings from an account.
  6 12 Under current law, account holders are allowed a deduction
  6 13 for the first $2,000 of contributions made to an account
  6 14 during a tax year, and that $2,000 annual limit is indexed to
  6 15 inflation and increased each tax year.  Current law also sets a
  6 16 lifetime limit on the total amount of contributions that may be
  6 17 deductible on an account holder's income tax return equal to 10
  6 18 times the annual contribution limit determined for the year.
  6 19 The bill modifies this lifetime limit by setting it as an
  6 20 amount equal to 10 times the annual contribution limit for the
  6 21 year in which the account is first opened by an account holder.
  6 22    Also under current law, previously deducted account
  6 23 contributions are added back to income, and thus taxable, to
  6 24 the extent the amounts are later withdrawn from an account
  6 25 for purposes other than the payment or reimbursement of a
  6 26 designated beneficiary's eligible home costs under the program.
  6 27 The bill specifies that this add=back requirement also applies
  6 28 to previously deducted interest earned on the account.
  6 29    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 30 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
  6 31 or after that date.

  5 13                           EXPLANATION
  5 14 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  5 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  5 16    This bill makes numerous changes to the Iowa first=time
  5 17 homebuyer savings account program in Code chapter 541B
  5 18 (program).
  5 19    The bill removes the requirement that a first=time homebuyer
  5 20 be a resident of Iowa.  The bill modifies the definition of
  5 21 "first=time homebuyer savings account" under the program to
  5 22 provide that the account must constitute a savings deposit
  5 23 as that term is defined for purposes of the federal reserve
  5 24 system.  The bill modifies the definition of "single=family
  5 25 residence" under the program to include a reference to the
  5 26 definition of "single=family residence" under the uniform
  5 27 residential landlord and tenant law (Code chapter 562A), and to
  5 28 require that the single=family residence be owned and occupied
  5 29 by the designated beneficiary within 90 days of the closing
  5 30 date.
  5 31    The bill strikes the ability of a married couple filing joint
  5 32 individual income tax returns to establish and maintain a joint
  5 33 first=time homebuyer savings account (account).
  5 34    The bill modifies various deadlines for filing forms and
  5 35 making designations under the program from April 30 of the year
  6  1 following the year the account is opened, to the last day of
  6  2 the fourth month after the expiration of the tax year during
  6  3 which the account is opened.
  6  4    The bill strikes the requirement that an annual report for
  6  5 an account be included with the account holder's Iowa income
  6  6 tax return, and further strikes a requirement that an account
  6  7 holder submit a copy of the federal internal revenue service
  6  8 form 1099 related to an account with the account holder's Iowa
  6  9 income tax return.
  6 10    Finally, the bill makes changes to the income tax benefits
  6 11 related to contributions to and earnings from an account.
  6 12 Under current law, account holders are allowed a deduction
  6 13 for the first $2,000 of contributions made to an account
  6 14 during a tax year, and that $2,000 annual limit is indexed to
  6 15 inflation and increased each tax year.  Current law also sets a
  6 16 lifetime limit on the total amount of contributions that may be
  6 17 deductible on an account holder's income tax return equal to 10
  6 18 times the annual contribution limit determined for the year.
  6 19 The bill modifies this lifetime limit by setting it as an
  6 20 amount equal to 10 times the annual contribution limit for the
  6 21 year in which the account is first opened by an account holder.
  6 22    Also under current law, previously deducted account
  6 23 contributions are added back to income, and thus taxable, to
  6 24 the extent the amounts are later withdrawn from an account
  6 25 for purposes other than the payment or reimbursement of a
  6 26 designated beneficiary's eligible home costs under the program.
  6 27 The bill specifies that this add=back requirement also applies
  6 28 to previously deducted interest earned on the account.
  6 29    The bill takes effect upon enactment and applies
  6 30 retroactively to January 1, 2018, for tax years beginning on
  6 31 or after that date.
