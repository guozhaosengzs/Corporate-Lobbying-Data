  1 11 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 12 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 13    The high quality jobs program administered by the economic
  1 14 development authority makes several types of tax incentives
  1 15 available to eligible businesses that engage in a project in
  1 16 the state.  The type and amount of tax incentives available
  1 17 is determined, among other factors, using a progressive scale
  1 18 based on the number of jobs created or retained by the project
  1 19 and the amount of qualifying capital investment involved in
  1 20 the project.  Under the first and lowest category on the
  1 21 tax incentive scale, an eligible business is eligible for
  1 22 certain tax incentives according to the amount of qualifying
  1 23 capital investment it makes, and if the number of jobs created
  1 24 or retained by the project is zero.  The bill strikes that
  1 25 category.  An eligible business will now be required to engage
  1 26 in a project that creates or retains at least one job in order
  1 27 to qualify for tax incentives under the program.
  1 28    The bill applies to high quality jobs program agreements
  1 29 entered into on or after July 1, 2017, and high quality jobs
  1 30 program agreements entered into prior to July 1, 2017, shall be
