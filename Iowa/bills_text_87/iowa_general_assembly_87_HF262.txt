 15  5                           EXPLANATION
 15  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 15  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 15  8    This bill relates to a fiduciary's access to digital assets
 15  9 and includes applicability provisions.
 15 10    The bill defines "digital asset" as an electronic record in
 15 11 which an individual has a right or interest.  "Digital asset"
 15 12 does not include an underlying asset or liability unless the
 15 13 asset or liability is itself an electronic record. "Digital
 15 14 asset" does not include health information or individually
 15 15 identifiable health information as those terms are defined in
 15 16 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
 15 17 Act. "Fiduciary" is defined as an agent under a power of
 15 18 attorney pursuant to Code chapter 633B, a conservator,
 15 19 guardian, personal representative, or trustee as each is
 15 20 defined under Code section 633.3, or a trustee as defined in
 15 21 Code section 633A.1102. "Custodian" is defined as a person
 15 22 that carries, maintains, processes, receives, or stores a
 15 23 digital asset of a user. "User" is defined as a person that has
 15 24 an account with a custodian.
 15 25    The bill provides that a user may direct a custodian to
 15 26 disclose to the designated recipient or not to disclose
 15 27 the user's digital assets to a fiduciary through an online
 15 28 tool, a will, trust, power of attorney, or other record. A
 15 29 terms=of=service agreement which the user agreed to may also
 15 30 provide whether the custodian shall disclose the user's digital
 15 31 assets to a fiduciary.
 15 32    The bill provides that a custodian shall disclose the
 15 33 electronic communications of a deceased user to the personal
 15 34 representative of the estate if the personal representative
 15 35 provides the custodian a written request for disclosure,
 16  1 a certified copy of the death certificate, letters of
 16  2 appointment, and documentation evidencing the user's consent
 16  3 to disclosure of the content of electronic communications,
 16  4 unless the user provided such direction in an online
 16  5 tool. A custodian shall disclose other digital assets of a
 16  6 deceased user to the personal representative if the personal
 16  7 representative provides a written request for disclosure,
 16  8 a certified copy of the death certificate, and letters of
 16  9 appointment.
 16 10    The bill provides that if a power of attorney expressly
 16 11 grants an agent authority over the content of electronic
 16 12 communications, a custodian shall disclose such content if
 16 13 the agent provides to the custodian a written request for
 16 14 disclosure, a copy of the power of attorney expressly granting
 16 15 the agent authority over the content of the principal's
 16 16 electronic communications, and a certification by the agent
 16 17 that the power of attorney is in effect. Where a power of
 16 18 attorney grants an agent specific authority over digital
 16 19 assets or general authority to act on behalf of the principal,
 16 20 the custodian shall disclose a catalogue of electronic
 16 21 communications sent or received by the principal and digital
 16 22 assets, other than the content of electronic communications,
 16 23 if the agent provides to the custodian a written request for
 16 24 disclosure, a copy of the power of attorney giving the agent
 16 25 specific authority over digital assets or general authority
 16 26 to act on behalf of the principal, and a certification by the
 16 27 agent that the power of attorney is in effect.
 16 28    The bill provides that a custodian shall disclose to a
 16 29 trustee that is an original user of an account any digital
 16 30 asset of the account held in trust. The bill provides that
 16 31 unless otherwise ordered by the court, directed by the user, or
 16 32 provided in a trust, a custodian shall disclose to a trustee
 16 33 that is not an original user the content of an electronic
 16 34 communication sent or received by a user if the trustee gives
 16 35 the custodian a written request, a certified copy of the trust
 17  1 that includes consent to disclose the content of electronic
 17  2 communications to the trustee, and a certification by the
 17  3 trustee that the trust exists and the trustee is a currently
 17  4 acting trustee. A custodian shall disclose to a trustee
 17  5 digital assets in which the trust has an interest and that
 17  6 are not electronic communications if the trustee gives the
 17  7 custodian a written request, a certified copy of the trust
 17  8 instrument or certification, and a certification by the trustee
 17  9 that the trust exists and the trustee is a currently acting
 17 10 trustee.
 17 11    The bill provides that after an opportunity for a hearing,
 17 12 the court may grant a conservator or guardian access to
 17 13 a ward's digital assets. The bill also provides that a
 17 14 custodian shall disclose to a conservator or guardian the
 17 15 catalogue of electronic communications of a ward and any of
 17 16 the ward's other digital assets, other than the content of
 17 17 electronic communications, if the conservator or guardian
 17 18 provides the custodian with a written request for disclosure
 17 19 and a copy of the court order that gives the conservator or
 17 20 guardian authority over the ward's digital assets. If the
 17 21 conservatorship or guardianship is not limited, the conservator
 17 22 or guardian may request a custodian to suspend or terminate an
 17 23 account of the ward for good cause.
 17 24    The bill imposes on a fiduciary the duties of care, loyalty,
 17 25 and confidentiality and specifies a fiduciary's authority with
 17 26 respect to digital assets of a user.
 17 27    The bill provides that a custodian has 60 days to comply with
 17 28 a request under the new Code chapter. If the custodian fails
 17 29 to comply, the fiduciary may apply for a court order directing
 17 30 compliance.
 17 31    The bill provides that a custodian and the custodian's
 17 32 officers, employees, and agents are immune from liability for
 17 33 an act or omission done in good faith in compliance with the
 17 34 new Code chapter.
 17 35    The bill provides applicability provisions. The bill
 18  1 applies to a fiduciary acting under a will or a power of
 18  2 attorney executed before, on, or after the effective date of
 18  3 the bill. The bill applies to a personal representative acting
 18  4 for a decedent who dies before, on, or after the effective date
 18  5 of the bill. The bill applies to a conservator or guardian
 18  6 acting for a ward on or after the effective date of the bill.
 18  7 The bill applies to a trustee acting under a trust created
 18  8 before, on, or after the effective date of the bill.
 18  9    The bill makes conforming changes.

 15 31 assets to a fiduciary.
 15 32    The bill provides that a custodian shall disclose the
 15 33 electronic communications of a deceased user to the personal

 16  3 to disclosure of the content of electronic communications,
 16  4 unless the user provided such direction in an online

 16 10    The bill provides that if a power of attorney expressly

 15 12 does not include an underlying asset or liability unless the
 15 13 asset or liability is itself an electronic record. "Digital
 15 14 asset" does not include health information or individually

 15 35 provides the custodian a written request for disclosure,
 16  1 a certified copy of the death certificate, letters of
 16  2 appointment, and documentation evidencing the user's consent
 16  3 to disclosure of the content of electronic communications,
 16  4 unless the user provided such direction in an online

 17  8 instrument or certification, and a certification by the trustee
 17  9 that the trust exists and the trustee is a currently acting
 17 10 trustee.
