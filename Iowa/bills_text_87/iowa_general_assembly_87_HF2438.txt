  7 26 received by the school district under section 257.16.  This
  7 27 specification of the payment of the state cost shall be deemed
  7 28 to meet all of the state funding=related requirements of
  7 29 section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional state funding
  7 30 shall be necessary for the full implementation of this Act
  7 31 by and enforcement of this Act against all affected school
  7 32 districts.
  7 33                           EXPLANATION
  7 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8  1 Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
  8  2 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
  8  3 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
  8  4 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to consumers
  8  5 or users, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  8  6 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  8  7 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  8  8 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  8  9 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  8 10 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  8 11 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  8 12 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  8 13 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  8 14 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  8 15 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  8 16 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  8 17 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  8 18    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  8 19 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  8 20 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  8 21      Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to distribution of
  8 22 SAVE revenues to school districts, 2.1 percent of the moneys
  8 23 available in the SAVE fund are distributed and credited to
  8 24 the property tax equity and relief (PTER) fund to be used for
  8 25 additional property tax levy aid. The bill provides that
  8 26 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the
  8 27 percentage used to determine the amount of the transfer from
  8 28 the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is equal to the percentage for
  8 29 the immediately preceding fiscal year, unless the amount of
  8 30 money available in the SAVE fund in the fiscal year is equal to
  8 31 or exceeds 102 percent of the amount of money available in the
  8 32 SAVE fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year, in which
  8 33 case the percentage shall be the percentage for the immediately
  8 34 preceding fiscal year plus 1 percent.  However, the bill caps
  8 35 the percentage at 10 percent.
  9  1 Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  9  2 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  9  3 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  9  4 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  9  5 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  9  6 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  9  7 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  9  8 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  9  9 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  9 16 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023, or the validity
  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.
  9 20    The bill provides that prior to approving the use of SAVE
  9 21 revenues for an athletic facility infrastructure project
  9 22 that is defined in the bill to mean a school infrastructure
  9 23 project that includes in whole or in part, the construction
  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first
  9 25 hold an additional public hearing on the issue of the athletic
  9 26 facility.  The bill defines "athletic facility" to mean
  9 27 a building or structure, or portion thereof, that is not
  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

  7 23 with section 25B.2, subsection 3, the state cost of requiring
  7 24 compliance with any state mandate included in this Act shall
  7 25 be paid by a school district from state school foundation aid
  7 26 received by the school district under section 257.16.  This
  7 27 specification of the payment of the state cost shall be deemed
  7 28 to meet all of the state funding=related requirements of

  7 30 shall be necessary for the full implementation of this Act

  8 10 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education

  8 12 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  8 13 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  8 14 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  8 15 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  8 16 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  8 17 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.

  8 32 SAVE fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year, in which
  8 33 case the percentage shall be the percentage for the immediately
  8 34 preceding fiscal year plus 1 percent.  However, the bill caps
  8 35 the percentage at 10 percent.
  9  1 Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  9  2 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate

  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include

  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections

  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.

  7 24 compliance with any state mandate included in this Act shall
  7 25 be paid by a school district from state school foundation aid
  7 26 received by the school district under section 257.16.  This
  7 27 specification of the payment of the state cost shall be deemed
  7 28 to meet all of the state funding=related requirements of
  7 29 section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional state funding
  7 30 shall be necessary for the full implementation of this Act
  7 31 by and enforcement of this Act against all affected school
  7 32 districts.
  7 33                           EXPLANATION
  7 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8  1 Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
  8  2 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
  8  3 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
  8  4 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to consumers
  8  5 or users, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  8  6 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  8  7 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  8  8 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  8  9 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  8 10 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  8 11 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  8 12 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  8 13 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  8 14 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  8 15 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  8 16 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  8 17 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  8 18    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  8 19 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  8 20 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  8 21      Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to distribution of
  8 22 SAVE revenues to school districts, 2.1 percent of the moneys
  8 23 available in the SAVE fund are distributed and credited to
  8 24 the property tax equity and relief (PTER) fund to be used for
  8 25 additional property tax levy aid. The bill provides that
  8 26 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the
  8 27 percentage used to determine the amount of the transfer from
  8 28 the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is equal to the percentage for
  8 29 the immediately preceding fiscal year, unless the amount of
  8 30 money available in the SAVE fund in the fiscal year is equal to
  8 31 or exceeds 102 percent of the amount of money available in the
  8 32 SAVE fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year, in which
  8 33 case the percentage shall be the percentage for the immediately
  8 34 preceding fiscal year plus 1 percent.  However, the bill caps
  8 35 the percentage at 10 percent.
  9  1 Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  9  2 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  9  3 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  9  4 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  9  5 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  9  6 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  9  7 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  9  8 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  9  9 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  9 16 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023, or the validity
  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.
  9 20    The bill provides that prior to approving the use of SAVE
  9 21 revenues for an athletic facility infrastructure project
  9 22 that is defined in the bill to mean a school infrastructure
  9 23 project that includes in whole or in part, the construction
  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first
  9 25 hold an additional public hearing on the issue of the athletic
  9 26 facility.  The bill defines "athletic facility" to mean
  9 27 a building or structure, or portion thereof, that is not
  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

  7 27 specification of the payment of the state cost shall be deemed
  7 28 to meet all of the state funding=related requirements of
  7 29 section 25B.2, subsection 3, and no additional state funding
  7 30 shall be necessary for the full implementation of this Act
  7 31 by and enforcement of this Act against all affected school

  7 33                           EXPLANATION
  7 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8  1 Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
  8  2 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
  8  3 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
  8  4 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to consumers
  8  5 or users, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  8  6 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  8  7 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  8  8 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  8  9 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  8 10 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  8 11 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  8 12 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  8 13 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  8 14 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  8 15 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  8 16 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  8 17 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  8 18    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  8 19 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  8 20 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  8 21      Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to distribution of
  8 22 SAVE revenues to school districts, 2.1 percent of the moneys
  8 23 available in the SAVE fund are distributed and credited to
  8 24 the property tax equity and relief (PTER) fund to be used for
  8 25 additional property tax levy aid. The bill provides that
  8 26 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the
  8 27 percentage used to determine the amount of the transfer from
  8 28 the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is equal to the percentage for
  8 29 the immediately preceding fiscal year, unless the amount of
  8 30 money available in the SAVE fund in the fiscal year is equal to
  8 31 or exceeds 102 percent of the amount of money available in the
  8 32 SAVE fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year, in which
  8 33 case the percentage shall be the percentage for the immediately
  8 34 preceding fiscal year plus 1 percent.  However, the bill caps
  8 35 the percentage at 10 percent.
  9  1 Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  9  2 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  9  3 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  9  4 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  9  5 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  9  6 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  9  7 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  9  8 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  9  9 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  9 16 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023, or the validity
  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.
  9 20    The bill provides that prior to approving the use of SAVE
  9 21 revenues for an athletic facility infrastructure project
  9 22 that is defined in the bill to mean a school infrastructure
  9 23 project that includes in whole or in part, the construction
  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first
  9 25 hold an additional public hearing on the issue of the athletic
  9 26 facility.  The bill defines "athletic facility" to mean
  9 27 a building or structure, or portion thereof, that is not
  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for

  9 27 a building or structure, or portion thereof, that is not
  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

  7 33                           EXPLANATION
  7 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8  1 Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
  8  2 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
  8  3 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
  8  4 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to consumers
  8  5 or users, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  8  6 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  8  7 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  8  8 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  8  9 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  8 10 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  8 11 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  8 12 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  8 13 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  8 14 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  8 15 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  8 16 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  8 17 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  8 18    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  8 19 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  8 20 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  8 21      Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to distribution of
  8 22 SAVE revenues to school districts, 2.1 percent of the moneys
  8 23 available in the SAVE fund are distributed and credited to
  8 24 the property tax equity and relief (PTER) fund to be used for
  8 25 additional property tax levy aid. The bill provides that
  8 26 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the
  8 27 percentage used to determine the amount of the transfer from
  8 28 the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is equal to the percentage for
  8 29 the immediately preceding fiscal year, unless the amount of
  8 30 money available in the SAVE fund in the fiscal year is equal to
  8 31 or exceeds 102 percent of the amount of money available in the
  8 32 SAVE fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year, in which
  8 33 case the percentage shall be the percentage for the immediately
  8 34 preceding fiscal year plus 1 percent.  However, the bill caps
  8 35 the percentage at 10 percent.
  9  1 Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  9  2 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  9  3 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  9  4 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  9  5 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  9  6 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  9  7 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  9  8 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  9  9 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  9 16 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023, or the validity
  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.
  9 20    The bill provides that prior to approving the use of SAVE
  9 21 revenues for an athletic facility infrastructure project
  9 22 that is defined in the bill to mean a school infrastructure
  9 23 project that includes in whole or in part, the construction
  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first
  9 25 hold an additional public hearing on the issue of the athletic
  9 26 facility.  The bill defines "athletic facility" to mean

  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an

 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The

  9  5 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  9  6 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  9  7 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  9  8 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  9  9 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  9 16 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023, or the validity
  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.
  9 20    The bill provides that prior to approving the use of SAVE
  9 21 revenues for an athletic facility infrastructure project
  9 22 that is defined in the bill to mean a school infrastructure
  9 23 project that includes in whole or in part, the construction
  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first
  9 25 hold an additional public hearing on the issue of the athletic
  9 26 facility.  The bill defines "athletic facility" to mean
  9 27 a building or structure, or portion thereof, that is not
  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

  7 33                           EXPLANATION
  7 34 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  7 35 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8  1 Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
  8  2 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
  8  3 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
  8  4 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to consumers
  8  5 or users, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  8  6 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  8  7 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  8  8 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  8  9 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  8 10 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  8 11 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  8 12 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  8 13 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  8 14 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  8 15 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  8 16 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  8 17 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  8 18    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  8 19 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  8 20 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  8 21      Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to distribution of
  8 22 SAVE revenues to school districts, 2.1 percent of the moneys
  8 23 available in the SAVE fund are distributed and credited to
  8 24 the property tax equity and relief (PTER) fund to be used for
  8 25 additional property tax levy aid. The bill provides that
  8 26 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the
  8 27 percentage used to determine the amount of the transfer from
  8 28 the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is equal to the percentage for
  8 29 the immediately preceding fiscal year, unless the amount of
  8 30 money available in the SAVE fund in the fiscal year is equal to
  8 31 or exceeds 102 percent of the amount of money available in the
  8 32 SAVE fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year, in which
  8 33 case the percentage shall be the percentage for the immediately
  8 34 preceding fiscal year plus 1 percent.  However, the bill caps
  8 35 the percentage at 10 percent.
  9  1 Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  9  2 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  9  3 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  9  4 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  9  5 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school

  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  9 16 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023, or the validity
  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district

  8 26 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the
  8 27 percentage used to determine the amount of the transfer from
  8 28 the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is equal to the percentage for
  8 29 the immediately preceding fiscal year, unless the amount of
  8 30 money available in the SAVE fund in the fiscal year is equal to
  8 31 or exceeds 102 percent of the amount of money available in the
  8 32 SAVE fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year, in which
  8 33 case the percentage shall be the percentage for the immediately
  8 34 preceding fiscal year plus 1 percent.  However, the bill caps
  8 35 the percentage at 10 percent.
  9  1 Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  9  2 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  9  3 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  9  4 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  9  5 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  9  6 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  9  7 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  9  8 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  9  9 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  9 16 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023, or the validity
  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.
  9 20    The bill provides that prior to approving the use of SAVE
  9 21 revenues for an athletic facility infrastructure project
  9 22 that is defined in the bill to mean a school infrastructure
  9 23 project that includes in whole or in part, the construction
  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first
  9 25 hold an additional public hearing on the issue of the athletic
  9 26 facility.  The bill defines "athletic facility" to mean
  9 27 a building or structure, or portion thereof, that is not
  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

  8  1 Code section 423.2 imposes a state tax of 6 percent upon
  8  2 the sales price of all sales of tangible personal property,
  8  3 consisting of goods, wares, merchandise, and other items
  8  4 designated by statute, sold at retail in the state to consumers
  8  5 or users, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  8  6 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  8  7 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  8  8 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  8  9 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  8 10 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  8 11 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  8 12 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  8 13 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  8 14 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  8 15 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  8 16 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  8 17 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  8 18    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  8 19 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  8 20 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  8 21      Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to distribution of
  8 22 SAVE revenues to school districts, 2.1 percent of the moneys
  8 23 available in the SAVE fund are distributed and credited to
  8 24 the property tax equity and relief (PTER) fund to be used for
  8 25 additional property tax levy aid. The bill provides that
  8 26 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the
  8 27 percentage used to determine the amount of the transfer from
  8 28 the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is equal to the percentage for

  8 31 or exceeds 102 percent of the amount of money available in the
  8 32 SAVE fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year, in which
  8 33 case the percentage shall be the percentage for the immediately

  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections

  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.

 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of

 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors

  8 22 SAVE revenues to school districts, 2.1 percent of the moneys
  8 23 available in the SAVE fund are distributed and credited to
  8 24 the property tax equity and relief (PTER) fund to be used for
  8 25 additional property tax levy aid. The bill provides that
  8 26 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the
  8 27 percentage used to determine the amount of the transfer from
  8 28 the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is equal to the percentage for
  8 29 the immediately preceding fiscal year, unless the amount of
  8 30 money available in the SAVE fund in the fiscal year is equal to
  8 31 or exceeds 102 percent of the amount of money available in the
  8 32 SAVE fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year, in which
  8 33 case the percentage shall be the percentage for the immediately
  8 34 preceding fiscal year plus 1 percent.  However, the bill caps
  8 35 the percentage at 10 percent.
  9  1 Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  9  2 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  9  3 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  9  4 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  9  5 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  9  6 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  9  7 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  9  8 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  9  9 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  9 16 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023, or the validity
  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.
  9 20    The bill provides that prior to approving the use of SAVE
  9 21 revenues for an athletic facility infrastructure project
  9 22 that is defined in the bill to mean a school infrastructure
  9 23 project that includes in whole or in part, the construction
  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first
  9 25 hold an additional public hearing on the issue of the athletic
  9 26 facility.  The bill defines "athletic facility" to mean
  9 27 a building or structure, or portion thereof, that is not
  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

  8  5 or users, except as otherwise provided by Code chapter 423.
  8  6 Generally, by operation of law, a sale subject to the sales
  8  7 tax is also subject to the use tax. Following the transfer
  8  8 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  8  9 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  8 10 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  8 11 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  8 12 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  8 13 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  8 14 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  8 15 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  8 16 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  8 17 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  8 18    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  8 19 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  8 20 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  8 21      Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to distribution of

  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include

  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  9 16 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023, or the validity
  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.

 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may

  8 26 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the
  8 27 percentage used to determine the amount of the transfer from
  8 28 the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is equal to the percentage for
  8 29 the immediately preceding fiscal year, unless the amount of
  8 30 money available in the SAVE fund in the fiscal year is equal to
  8 31 or exceeds 102 percent of the amount of money available in the
  8 32 SAVE fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year, in which
  8 33 case the percentage shall be the percentage for the immediately
  8 34 preceding fiscal year plus 1 percent.  However, the bill caps
  8 35 the percentage at 10 percent.
  9  1 Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  9  2 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  9  3 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  9  4 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  9  5 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  9  6 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  9  7 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  9  8 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  9  9 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  9 16 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023, or the validity
  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.
  9 20    The bill provides that prior to approving the use of SAVE
  9 21 revenues for an athletic facility infrastructure project
  9 22 that is defined in the bill to mean a school infrastructure
  9 23 project that includes in whole or in part, the construction
  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first
  9 25 hold an additional public hearing on the issue of the athletic
  9 26 facility.  The bill defines "athletic facility" to mean
  9 27 a building or structure, or portion thereof, that is not
  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

  8  8 of amounts required by statute, if applicable, one=sixth of
  8  9 the remaining state sales tax revenue from the 6 percent tax
  8 10 is transferred to the secure an advanced vision for education
  8 11 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  8 12 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  8 13 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  8 14 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  8 15 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,
  8 16 2030, and Code chapter 423F, along with other corresponding
  8 17 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  8 18    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  8 19 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  8 20 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  8 21      Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to distribution of
  8 22 SAVE revenues to school districts, 2.1 percent of the moneys
  8 23 available in the SAVE fund are distributed and credited to
  8 24 the property tax equity and relief (PTER) fund to be used for
  8 25 additional property tax levy aid. The bill provides that
  8 26 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the
  8 27 percentage used to determine the amount of the transfer from
  8 28 the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is equal to the percentage for
  8 29 the immediately preceding fiscal year, unless the amount of
  8 30 money available in the SAVE fund in the fiscal year is equal to
  8 31 or exceeds 102 percent of the amount of money available in the
  8 32 SAVE fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year, in which
  8 33 case the percentage shall be the percentage for the immediately
  8 34 preceding fiscal year plus 1 percent.  However, the bill caps
  8 35 the percentage at 10 percent.

  9  5 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  9  6 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  9  7 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  9  8 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  9  9 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  9 16 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023, or the validity
  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.
  9 20    The bill provides that prior to approving the use of SAVE
  9 21 revenues for an athletic facility infrastructure project
  9 22 that is defined in the bill to mean a school infrastructure
  9 23 project that includes in whole or in part, the construction
  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first
  9 25 hold an additional public hearing on the issue of the athletic
  9 26 facility.  The bill defines "athletic facility" to mean
  9 27 a building or structure, or portion thereof, that is not
  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

  8 11 (SAVE) fund created in Code section 423F.2.  Moneys in the SAVE
  8 12 fund are allocated to school districts on a per pupil basis to
  8 13 be used for infrastructure and property tax reduction purposes
  8 14 specified in Code chapter 423F.  Under current law, the sales
  8 15 tax rate of 6 percent is reduced to 5 percent on January 1,

  8 24 the property tax equity and relief (PTER) fund to be used for
  8 25 additional property tax levy aid. The bill provides that
  8 26 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the
  8 27 percentage used to determine the amount of the transfer from
  8 28 the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is equal to the percentage for
  8 29 the immediately preceding fiscal year, unless the amount of
  8 30 money available in the SAVE fund in the fiscal year is equal to
  8 31 or exceeds 102 percent of the amount of money available in the
  8 32 SAVE fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year, in which
  8 33 case the percentage shall be the percentage for the immediately
  8 34 preceding fiscal year plus 1 percent.  However, the bill caps
  8 35 the percentage at 10 percent.

  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

  8 26 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the
  8 27 percentage used to determine the amount of the transfer from
  8 28 the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is equal to the percentage for

  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the

  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections

  9 23 project that includes in whole or in part, the construction
  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first

 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The

 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the

 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state

  8 17 provisions, is repealed December 31, 2029.
  8 18    This bill extends the 6 percent sales tax rate, the
  8 19 allocation to the SAVE fund, and the statutory repeal of Code
  8 20 chapter 423F until January 1, 2050.
  8 21      Code section 423F.2 provides that prior to distribution of
  8 22 SAVE revenues to school districts, 2.1 percent of the moneys
  8 23 available in the SAVE fund are distributed and credited to
  8 24 the property tax equity and relief (PTER) fund to be used for
  8 25 additional property tax levy aid. The bill provides that
  8 26 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the
  8 27 percentage used to determine the amount of the transfer from
  8 28 the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is equal to the percentage for
  8 29 the immediately preceding fiscal year, unless the amount of
  8 30 money available in the SAVE fund in the fiscal year is equal to
  8 31 or exceeds 102 percent of the amount of money available in the
  8 32 SAVE fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year, in which
  8 33 case the percentage shall be the percentage for the immediately
  8 34 preceding fiscal year plus 1 percent.  However, the bill caps
  8 35 the percentage at 10 percent.
  9  1 Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  9  2 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  9  3 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  9  4 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  9  5 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  9  6 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  9  7 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  9  8 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  9  9 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  9 16 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023, or the validity
  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.
  9 20    The bill provides that prior to approving the use of SAVE
  9 21 revenues for an athletic facility infrastructure project
  9 22 that is defined in the bill to mean a school infrastructure
  9 23 project that includes in whole or in part, the construction
  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first
  9 25 hold an additional public hearing on the issue of the athletic
  9 26 facility.  The bill defines "athletic facility" to mean
  9 27 a building or structure, or portion thereof, that is not
  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or

  8 25 additional property tax levy aid. The bill provides that
  8 26 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the
  8 27 percentage used to determine the amount of the transfer from
  8 28 the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is equal to the percentage for
  8 29 the immediately preceding fiscal year, unless the amount of
  8 30 money available in the SAVE fund in the fiscal year is equal to
  8 31 or exceeds 102 percent of the amount of money available in the
  8 32 SAVE fund for the immediately preceding fiscal year, in which
  8 33 case the percentage shall be the percentage for the immediately
  8 34 preceding fiscal year plus 1 percent.  However, the bill caps
  8 35 the percentage at 10 percent.
  9  1 Under the bill, revenue purpose statements for the use of
  9  2 SAVE fund revenues adopted before July 1, 2018, shall terminate
  9  3 and be of no further force and effect on January 1, 2023.
  9  4 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  9  5 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  9  6 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  9  7 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  9  8 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  9  9 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  9 16 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023, or the validity
  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.
  9 20    The bill provides that prior to approving the use of SAVE
  9 21 revenues for an athletic facility infrastructure project
  9 22 that is defined in the bill to mean a school infrastructure
  9 23 project that includes in whole or in part, the construction
  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first
  9 25 hold an additional public hearing on the issue of the athletic
  9 26 facility.  The bill defines "athletic facility" to mean
  9 27 a building or structure, or portion thereof, that is not
  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include

  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections

  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.

  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority

 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

  8 26 for each fiscal year beginning on or after July 1, 2018, the
  8 27 percentage used to determine the amount of the transfer from
  8 28 the SAVE fund to the PTER fund is equal to the percentage for

  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections

  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district

  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.
  9 20    The bill provides that prior to approving the use of SAVE
  9 21 revenues for an athletic facility infrastructure project
  9 22 that is defined in the bill to mean a school infrastructure

  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first

  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of

  9  7 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school
  9  8 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval
  9  9 by the electors on or after July 1, 2018, and such revenue
  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  9 16 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023, or the validity
  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.
  9 20    The bill provides that prior to approving the use of SAVE
  9 21 revenues for an athletic facility infrastructure project
  9 22 that is defined in the bill to mean a school infrastructure
  9 23 project that includes in whole or in part, the construction
  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first
  9 25 hold an additional public hearing on the issue of the athletic
  9 26 facility.  The bill defines "athletic facility" to mean
  9 27 a building or structure, or portion thereof, that is not
  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

  9  8 board must submit a revenue purpose statement for approval

  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections

 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may

  9  4 If a school district intends to use SAVE fund revenues for
  9  5 purposes other than those which can be approved by the school
  9  6 board alone and does not intend to operate without a revenue
  9  7 purpose statement on or after January 1, 2023, the school

  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.
  9 20    The bill provides that prior to approving the use of SAVE
  9 21 revenues for an athletic facility infrastructure project
  9 22 that is defined in the bill to mean a school infrastructure

  9 26 facility.  The bill defines "athletic facility" to mean
  9 27 a building or structure, or portion thereof, that is not
  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may

 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the

 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following

 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the

 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified

 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the

 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the

  9 10 purpose statement submitted to the electors shall include
  9 11 all proposed uses including those previously approved by the
  9 12 electors, if applicable. The bill specifies that if a revenue
  9 13 purpose statement is terminated on January 1, 2023, under the
  9 14 provisions of the bill, such termination shall not affect the
  9 15 validity of or a first lien on bonds issued under Code sections
  9 16 423E.5 and 423F.5 prior to January 1, 2023, or the validity
  9 17 of a contract or other obligation of the school district
  9 18 secured in whole or in part by or requiring the payment of SAVE
  9 19 revenues in effect prior to January 1, 2023.
  9 20    The bill provides that prior to approving the use of SAVE
  9 21 revenues for an athletic facility infrastructure project
  9 22 that is defined in the bill to mean a school infrastructure
  9 23 project that includes in whole or in part, the construction
  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first
  9 25 hold an additional public hearing on the issue of the athletic
  9 26 facility.  The bill defines "athletic facility" to mean
  9 27 a building or structure, or portion thereof, that is not
  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale

 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a

 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

  9 23 project that includes in whole or in part, the construction
  9 24 of an athletic facility, the board of directors must first
  9 25 hold an additional public hearing on the issue of the athletic
  9 26 facility.  The bill defines "athletic facility" to mean
  9 27 a building or structure, or portion thereof, that is not
  9 28 physically attached to a student attendance center. If at any
  9 29 time prior to the 15th day following the hearing, the secretary
  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of
 10 10 SAVE revenues for the athletic facility infrastructure project.
 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10 14 infrastructure project without voter approval.  The bill also
 10 15 establishes limitations on the period of time to bring an
 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate
 10 20 its share of SAVE fund revenues by issuing bonds without
 10 21 voter approval. The bill provides that revenue bonds issued
 10 22 on or after July 1, 2018, shall not be sold at public sale
 10 23 or at a private sale without notice and a public hearing.
 10 24 Additionally, if at any time prior to the 15th day following
 10 25 the hearing, the secretary of the board of directors receives
 10 26 a petition containing the required number of signatures and
 10 27 asking that the question of the issuance of such bonds be
 10 28 submitted to the voters of the school district, the school
 10 29 board shall either rescind its adoption of the resolution or
 10 30 direct the county commissioner of elections to submit the
 10 31 question to the registered voters of the school district. The
 10 32 petition must be signed by eligible electors equal in number to
 10 33 not less than 100 or 30 percent of the number of voters at the
 10 34 last preceding regular school election, whichever is greater.
 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a
 11  1 majority of those voting on the question favors issuance of the
 11  2 bonds, the board shall be authorized to issue the bonds.  The
 11  3 bill also places limitations on the period of time during which
 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply
 11  9 to the department of education for a certificate of need
 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
 11 17 department of education in determining whether to issue a
 11 18 certificate of need to include the cost=benefit analysis of
 11 19 remodeling, reconstructing, or repairing existing buildings
 11 20 versus new construction and consideration of the benefit of the
 11 21 new construction on student learning.
 11 22    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 23 section 25B.3.  The bill requires that the state cost of
 11 24 any state mandate included in the bill be paid by a school
 11 25 district from state school foundation aid received by the
 11 26 school district under section 257.16.  The specification is
 11 27 deemed to constitute state compliance with any state mandate
 11 28 funding=related requirements of Code section 25B.2.  The
 11 29 inclusion of this specification is intended to reinstate the
 11 30 requirement of political subdivisions to comply with any state
 11 31 mandates included in the bill.

  9 30 of the board of directors receives a petition containing the
  9 31 required number of signatures and asking that the question of
  9 32 the approval of the use of revenues for the athletic facility
  9 33 infrastructure project be submitted to the voters of the school
  9 34 district, the board of directors shall either rescind the
  9 35 resolution for use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility
 10  1 infrastructure project or direct the county commissioner of
 10  2 elections to submit the question to the registered voters of
 10  3 the school district. If a majority of those voting on the
 10  4 question favors the use of the SAVE revenues for the athletic
 10  5 facility infrastructure project, the board shall be authorized
 10  6 to approve such use by resolution of the board. If a majority
 10  7 of those voting on the question does not favor the use of the
 10  8 SAVE revenues for the school infrastructure project, the board
 10  9 of directors shall rescind the board's resolution for use of

 10 11 If a petition is not received by the board of directors
 10 12 within the prescribed time period, the board of directors may
 10 13 approve the use of SAVE revenues for the athletic facility

 10 16 action to question the authority to use funds  for such purpose
 10 17 or the legality of any proceedings in connection with the
 10 18 authorization of such use.
 10 19    Current law authorizes a school district to anticipate

 10 35 If the school board submits the question at an election and a

 11  4 an action questioning the legality or procedural compliance for
 11  5 the issuance of such bonds may be brought.
 11  6    Currently, a school district with a certified enrollment
 11  7 of fewer than 250 pupils in the entire district or certified
 11  8 enrollment of fewer than 100 pupils in high school must apply

 11 10 before the school district can expend the supplemental school
 11 11 infrastructure amount received for new construction or for
 11 12 payments for bonds issued for new construction against the
 11 13 supplemental school infrastructure amount. The bill increases
 11 14 the enrollment thresholds to a total enrollment of 350 pupils
 11 15 and to a high school enrollment of 140 pupils.
 11 16    The bill also modifies the criteria to be used by the
