  7 33 ineligible to receive benefits under a public assistance
  7 34 program under this section if the individual has a confirmed
  7 35 positive test result for the presence of either of the
  8  1 following:
  8  2    (1)  A substance listed in schedule I under section 124.204.
  8  3    (2)  A substance listed in schedule II, III, or IV under

  8  6 implementing this section:
  8  7    a.  (1)  Provide notice of drug testing to each individual
  8  8 who is subject to this section at the time of application.  The
  8  9 notice must advise the individual that drug testing will be
  8 10 conducted as a condition for receiving benefits under a public
  8 11 assistance program and that the individual must bear the cost
  8 12 of the drug testing.  If the individual's drug test results in
  8 13 a confirmed positive test result, the cost of the drug test
  8 14 shall not be reimbursed.  If the individual's drug test does
  8 15 not result in a confirmed positive test result, the cost of the

  8 17 disbursed pursuant to rules adopted by the department.  The
  8 18 applicant shall be advised that the required drug testing may
  8 19 be avoided if the applicant does not complete or withdraws the
  8 20 application for assistance.
  8 21    (2)  Advise each individual to be tested, before the test
  8 22 is conducted, that the individual may, but is not required to,
  8 23 advise the agent administering the test of any prescription or
  8 24 over=the=counter medication the individual is taking.
  8 25    (3)  Require each individual to be tested to sign a written
  8 26 acknowledgment that the individual has received and understood
  8 27 the notice and advice provided under this paragraph "a".
  8 28    b.  Ensure that each individual being tested has a reasonable
  8 29 degree of dignity while producing and submitting a sample for
  8 30 drug testing, consistent with the department's need to ensure
  8 31 the reliability of the sample.
  8 32    c.  Adopt rules specifying circumstances under which an
  8 33 individual with a confirmed positive test result has the right
  8 34 to retake the drug test.
  8 35    d.  Inform an individual who has a confirmed positive
  9  1 test result and is deemed ineligible for assistance that the
  9  2 individual may not reapply for assistance for one year after
  9  3 the date of the confirmed positive test result unless the
  9  4 individual meets the requirements of paragraph "f".  If the
  9  5 individual has a subsequent confirmed positive test result,
  9  6 the individual shall be ineligible to receive assistance for
  9  7 three years after the date of the subsequent result unless the
  9  8 individual meets the requirements of paragraph "f".
  9  9    e.  Provide any individual with a confirmed positive test
  9 10 result with a list of licensed substance abuse treatment
  9 11 programs available in the area in which the individual resides.

  9 14 the drug testing conducted under this section.
  9 15    f.  An individual with a confirmed positive test result
  9 16 who is denied benefits under this section may reapply for
  9 17 assistance after six months if the individual can document the
  9 18 successful completion of a licensed substance abuse treatment
  9 19 program. An individual who has met the requirements of this
  9 20 paragraph and reapplies for assistance must also pass the
  9 21 initial drug test required under subsection 2.  Any drug test
  9 22 conducted while the individual is undergoing substance abuse
  9 23 treatment must meet the requirements for a drug test under
  9 24 subsection 2. The cost of any drug testing or substance
  9 25 abuse treatment provided under this subsection shall be the
  9 26 responsibility of the individual being tested or receiving
  9 27 treatment.  An individual with a confirmed positive test result
  9 28 from the drug test required under subsection 2 may reapply for
  9 29 assistance under this paragraph only once.
  9 30    5.  a.  If an applicant is deemed ineligible for assistance
  9 31 as a result of having a confirmed positive test result from a
  9 32 drug test conducted under this section, the eligibility of the
  9 33 applicant's dependent child for assistance is not affected.
  9 34    b.  An appropriate protective payee shall be designated
  9 35 to receive assistance on behalf of the dependent child.
 10  1 The parent may choose to designate an individual as the
 10  2 protective payee.  The individual designated by the parent as
 10  3 the protective payee must be a specified relative or other
 10  4 immediate family member unless such family member is not

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 11  3 utilizing a numeric=based code assigned to the food item
 11  4 wherever the food item is sold throughout the state.
 11  5    2.  A retailer shall not allow a food assistance program
 11  6 recipient to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food
 11  7 and food items that are not included on the eligible food item
 11  8 list.
 11  9    3.  The department of human services shall assess a civil
 11 10 penalty against a retailer who violates this section of not
 11 11 more than one thousand dollars for a first violation, two
 11 12 thousand dollars for a second violation occurring within five
 11 13 years from the date of the first violation, or five thousand
 11 14 dollars for any subsequent violations.

 11 16 as defined in section 234.12A.
 11 17    Sec. 9.  FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ==== AUTHORITY TO RESTRICT
 11 18 USE OF BENEFITS.  The department of human services shall submit
 11 19 a request to the United States department of agriculture

 11 21 other approach for restricting the use of food assistance
 11 22 benefits, as administered by the state under the federal
 11 23 supplemental nutrition assistance program for food and food
 11 24 items with a low nutritional value that cost more than eight
 11 25 dollars per pound or that purport to provide an additional
 11 26 potential health benefit or reduce a potential adverse health
 11 27 effect to consumers when compared to less expensive food
 11 28 items.  The request shall include a proposal for a thorough
 11 29 process evaluation to document how the restrictions will be
 11 30 implemented by both the state and retailers, with a study
 11 31 design that includes counterfactual data indicating the
 11 32 effects of the absence of such restrictions on food assistance
 11 33 program recipients, and a full cost estimate that addresses
 11 34 both federal and state costs and savings associated with
 11 35 such restrictions.  The request shall be submitted within
 12  1 ninety days of the effective date of this section of this Act.
 12  2 The department shall regularly report on the status of the
 12  3 request to the chairpersons and ranking members of the general
 12  4 assembly's standing committees on commerce and the legislative
 12  5 services agency.
 12  6    Sec. 10.  ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION.

 12 19 department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 12 20 project, or other approach for restricting the use of certain
 12 21 food assistance benefits.  The department of human services
 12 22 shall notify the Code editor upon the receipt of such approval.
 12 23    5.  The provisions of this Act not requiring approval of a
 12 24 Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver or approval from the
 12 25 United States department of agriculture shall be implemented

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 11 10 penalty against a retailer who violates this section of not
 11 11 more than one thousand dollars for a first violation, two
 11 12 thousand dollars for a second violation occurring within five
 11 13 years from the date of the first violation, or five thousand

 11 24 items with a low nutritional value that cost more than eight
 11 25 dollars per pound or that purport to provide an additional

 11 29 process evaluation to document how the restrictions will be
 11 30 implemented by both the state and retailers, with a study
 11 31 design that includes counterfactual data indicating the
 11 32 effects of the absence of such restrictions on food assistance
 11 33 program recipients, and a full cost estimate that addresses

 12 19 department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 12 20 project, or other approach for restricting the use of certain
 12 21 food assistance benefits.  The department of human services
 12 22 shall notify the Code editor upon the receipt of such approval.
 12 23    5.  The provisions of this Act not requiring approval of a
 12 24 Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver or approval from the
 12 25 United States department of agriculture shall be implemented
 12 26 on January 1, 2019.

 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 11 10 penalty against a retailer who violates this section of not
 11 11 more than one thousand dollars for a first violation, two
 11 12 thousand dollars for a second violation occurring within five
 11 13 years from the date of the first violation, or five thousand
 11 14 dollars for any subsequent violations.

 11 21 other approach for restricting the use of food assistance
 11 22 benefits, as administered by the state under the federal
 11 23 supplemental nutrition assistance program for food and food
 11 24 items with a low nutritional value that cost more than eight
 11 25 dollars per pound or that purport to provide an additional
 11 26 potential health benefit or reduce a potential adverse health
 11 27 effect to consumers when compared to less expensive food
 11 28 items.  The request shall include a proposal for a thorough
 11 29 process evaluation to document how the restrictions will be
 11 30 implemented by both the state and retailers, with a study
 11 31 design that includes counterfactual data indicating the
 11 32 effects of the absence of such restrictions on food assistance
 11 33 program recipients, and a full cost estimate that addresses
 11 34 both federal and state costs and savings associated with
 11 35 such restrictions.  The request shall be submitted within
 12  1 ninety days of the effective date of this section of this Act.
 12  2 The department shall regularly report on the status of the
 12  3 request to the chairpersons and ranking members of the general

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 11 12 thousand dollars for a second violation occurring within five
 11 13 years from the date of the first violation, or five thousand

 11 24 items with a low nutritional value that cost more than eight
 11 25 dollars per pound or that purport to provide an additional
 11 26 potential health benefit or reduce a potential adverse health
 11 27 effect to consumers when compared to less expensive food
 11 28 items.  The request shall include a proposal for a thorough
 11 29 process evaluation to document how the restrictions will be
 11 30 implemented by both the state and retailers, with a study
 11 31 design that includes counterfactual data indicating the
 11 32 effects of the absence of such restrictions on food assistance
 11 33 program recipients, and a full cost estimate that addresses

 12 17    4.  The section of this Act enacting section 234.13A is
 12 18 contingent upon receipt of approval from the United States
 12 19 department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 12 20 project, or other approach for restricting the use of certain
 12 21 food assistance benefits.  The department of human services
 12 22 shall notify the Code editor upon the receipt of such approval.

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 11 11 more than one thousand dollars for a first violation, two
 11 12 thousand dollars for a second violation occurring within five
 11 13 years from the date of the first violation, or five thousand
 11 14 dollars for any subsequent violations.

 11 21 other approach for restricting the use of food assistance
 11 22 benefits, as administered by the state under the federal
 11 23 supplemental nutrition assistance program for food and food
 11 24 items with a low nutritional value that cost more than eight
 11 25 dollars per pound or that purport to provide an additional
 11 26 potential health benefit or reduce a potential adverse health
 11 27 effect to consumers when compared to less expensive food
 11 28 items.  The request shall include a proposal for a thorough
 11 29 process evaluation to document how the restrictions will be
 11 30 implemented by both the state and retailers, with a study
 11 31 design that includes counterfactual data indicating the
 11 32 effects of the absence of such restrictions on food assistance
 11 33 program recipients, and a full cost estimate that addresses
 11 34 both federal and state costs and savings associated with
 11 35 such restrictions.  The request shall be submitted within

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 11 18 USE OF BENEFITS.  The department of human services shall submit
 11 19 a request to the United States department of agriculture
 11 20 for authorization for a five=year waiver, pilot project, or
 11 21 other approach for restricting the use of food assistance
 11 22 benefits, as administered by the state under the federal
 11 23 supplemental nutrition assistance program for food and food
 11 24 items with a low nutritional value that cost more than eight
 11 25 dollars per pound or that purport to provide an additional
 11 26 potential health benefit or reduce a potential adverse health
 11 27 effect to consumers when compared to less expensive food
 11 28 items.  The request shall include a proposal for a thorough
 11 29 process evaluation to document how the restrictions will be
 11 30 implemented by both the state and retailers, with a study
 11 31 design that includes counterfactual data indicating the

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 11 19 a request to the United States department of agriculture
 11 20 for authorization for a five=year waiver, pilot project, or
 11 21 other approach for restricting the use of food assistance
 11 22 benefits, as administered by the state under the federal
 11 23 supplemental nutrition assistance program for food and food
 11 24 items with a low nutritional value that cost more than eight
 11 25 dollars per pound or that purport to provide an additional
 11 26 potential health benefit or reduce a potential adverse health
 11 27 effect to consumers when compared to less expensive food
 11 28 items.  The request shall include a proposal for a thorough
 11 29 process evaluation to document how the restrictions will be

 12 35 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of

 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility

 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the

 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the

 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.

 11 22 benefits, as administered by the state under the federal
 11 23 supplemental nutrition assistance program for food and food
 11 24 items with a low nutritional value that cost more than eight

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of

 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an

 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its

 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public

 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to

 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a

 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting

 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least

 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding

 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates

 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.

 12 34 United States department of agriculture, being deemed of
 12 35 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 11 25 dollars per pound or that purport to provide an additional
 11 26 potential health benefit or reduce a potential adverse health
 11 27 effect to consumers when compared to less expensive food
 11 28 items.  The request shall include a proposal for a thorough
 11 29 process evaluation to document how the restrictions will be
 11 30 implemented by both the state and retailers, with a study
 11 31 design that includes counterfactual data indicating the
 11 32 effects of the absence of such restrictions on food assistance
 11 33 program recipients, and a full cost estimate that addresses
 11 34 both federal and state costs and savings associated with
 11 35 such restrictions.  The request shall be submitted within

 12 21 food assistance benefits.  The department of human services
 12 22 shall notify the Code editor upon the receipt of such approval.

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 11 28 items.  The request shall include a proposal for a thorough
 11 29 process evaluation to document how the restrictions will be
 11 30 implemented by both the state and retailers, with a study
 11 31 design that includes counterfactual data indicating the
 11 32 effects of the absence of such restrictions on food assistance
 11 33 program recipients, and a full cost estimate that addresses

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 11 30 implemented by both the state and retailers, with a study
 11 31 design that includes counterfactual data indicating the
 11 32 effects of the absence of such restrictions on food assistance
 11 33 program recipients, and a full cost estimate that addresses
 11 34 both federal and state costs and savings associated with
 11 35 such restrictions.  The request shall be submitted within
 12  1 ninety days of the effective date of this section of this Act.
 12  2 The department shall regularly report on the status of the
 12  3 request to the chairpersons and ranking members of the general

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a

 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.

 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,

 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting

 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to

 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances

 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt

 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill

 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value

 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value

 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of

 12 24 Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver or approval from the
 12 25 United States department of agriculture shall be implemented
 12 26 on January 1, 2019.

 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 12 24 Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver or approval from the
 12 25 United States department of agriculture shall be implemented
 12 26 on January 1, 2019.

 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility

 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an

 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and

 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug

 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A

 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 12 27    Sec. 11.  DIRECTIVE TO CODE EDITOR.  The Code editor shall
 12 28 codify the provisions of this Act enacting sections 217.41C,
 12 29 217.41D, 217.41E, 217.41F, 217.41G, 217.41H, and 217.41I as

 12 31    Sec. 12.  EFFECTIVE DATE.  The section of this Act directing
 12 32 the department of human services to submit a request for a
 12 33 five=year waiver, pilot project, or other approach to the
 12 34 United States department of agriculture, being deemed of
 12 35 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.

 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value

 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.

 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 12 34 United States department of agriculture, being deemed of
 12 35 immediate importance, takes effect upon enactment.
 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.

 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that

 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its

 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of

 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 13  1                           EXPLANATION
 13  2 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13  3 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the

 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an

 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the

 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug

 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this

 13  4    This bill relates to public assistance program oversight.
 13  5 For purposes of the bill, "public assistance program" includes
 13  6 but is not limited to the Medicaid program, the family
 13  7 investment program (FIP), and the supplemental nutrition
 13  8 assistance program (SNAP).
 13  9    The bill provides for verification of a public assistance
 13 10 program applicant's eligibility.  The department of human
 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt

 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an

 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug

 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to

 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible

 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit

 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least

 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.
 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The

 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy

 13 11 services (DHS) is required to implement an eligibility
 13 12 verification system for public assistance programs to verify
 13 13 the eligibility of an individual who is an applicant for
 13 14 any such program.  The bill specifies the information to
 13 15 be verified; requires DHS to enter into a memorandum of
 13 16 understanding with any department or subunit of a department,
 13 17 as necessary, to obtain the information specified; and
 13 18 authorizes DHS to contract with a third=party vendor to
 13 19 provide the information specified, subject to a provision
 13 20 in the contract that ensures that annualized savings to the
 13 21 state exceed the contract's total annual cost to the state.
 13 22 The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving, reviewing, or
 13 23 verifying additional information related to the eligibility of
 13 24 an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 13 25 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 13 26 specified in the bill.
 13 27    The bill requires DHS to require that an applicant for a
 13 28 public assistance program demonstrate residency in the state
 13 29 for at least one year prior to submission of the application.
 13 30 The department shall require that the applicant specify the
 13 31 county in which the applicant has resided, the length of
 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.

 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that

 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the
 15  6 child support recovery unit in establishing and enforcing a
 15  7 child support order pursuant to federal law.
 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.

 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.

 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an

 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its

 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food

 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of

 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to

 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt

 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy

 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in

 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.

 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving

 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's

 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an

 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.

 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy

 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,

 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its

 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of

 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a

 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a

 13 32 residence in the state, and state that the maintenance of the
 13 33 residence has been in good faith and not for the purposes
 13 34 of obtaining public assistance benefits only. An individual
 13 35 who fails to demonstrate residency in the state for at least
 14  1 one year prior to submission of an application for public
 14  2 assistance benefits shall be ineligible to receive such
 14  3 benefits.

 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates

 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential

 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public

 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A

 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.

 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its

 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for

 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of

 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon

 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.

 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility

 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not

 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a

 14  4    The bill provides for real=time monitoring of the
 14  5 eligibility of public assistance program enrollees. The
 14  6 bill requires DHS, as least quarterly, to obtain and review
 14  7 specified information to determine ongoing eligibility of
 14  8 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program.  The
 14  9 bill requires DHS to enter into memoranda of understanding
 14 10 with any department or subunit of a department, as necessary,
 14 11 to obtain the information specified; authorizes DHS to
 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about

 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the

 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for

 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a
 17 32 waiver, pilot project, or other approach restricting the use of
 17 33 certain food assistance benefits takes effect upon enactment.

 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a

 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.

 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy

 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's

 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in

 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for

 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the

 14 12 contract with a third=party vendor to provide the information
 14 13 specified, subject to a provision in the contract that ensures
 14 14 that annualized savings to the state exceed the contract's
 14 15 total annual cost to the state; and requires DHS to explore
 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy
 14 19 clearinghouse.  The bill does not preclude DHS from receiving
 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that
 14 34 exceed the resource limitations specified in federal law,
 14 35 unless specifically required under federal law.  Additionally,
 15  1 the bill provides that categorical eligibility shall not exempt
 15  2 households from these resource limits for any noncash, in=kind,
 15  3 or other benefit, unless expressly required by federal law.
 15  4    The bill requires DHS to require, as a condition of
 15  5 eligibility for SNAP, that an individual cooperate with the

 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.

 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of
 15 32 the bill relating to verification of applicant eligibility for
 15 33 public assistance programs and real=time eligibility monitoring
 15 34 of recipients of public assistance programs. The initial
 15 35 report must include information for the period beginning July
 16  1 1, 2018, and ending December 31, 2018.  The reports shall
 16  2 include the number of cases reviewed, the number of cases
 16  3 closed, the number of fraud investigation referrals made, and
 16  4 the amount of savings and cost avoidance resulting from the
 16  5 provisions of the bill.
 16  6    The bill requires DHS to submit, to the centers for Medicare
 16  7 and Medicaid services (CMS) of the United States department of
 16  8 health and human services, any Medicaid state plan amendment or
 16  9 waiver request necessary to administer the bill.
 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of
 16 18 18 years, DHS is directed to require a drug test for each
 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug
 16 26 testing requirement. If a parent is deemed ineligible for
 16 27 assistance as a result of having a confirmed positive test
 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
 17 28 of approval from the United States department of agriculture.
 17 29 The department of human services is required to notify the Code
 17 30 editor upon receipt of the approval.
 17 31    The directive to the department to submit a request for a

 14 16 opportunities to join existing multistate collaborations to
 14 17 identify individuals who are also enrolled in public assistance
 14 18 programs outside of the state, including the national accuracy

 14 20 or reviewing additional information related to the eligibility
 14 21 of an individual not specified in the bill or from contracting
 14 22 with a third=party vendor to provide additional information not
 14 23 specified in the bill.
 14 24    The bill provides that if DHS receives information about
 14 25 an individual enrolled in a public assistance program that
 14 26 indicates a potential change or discrepancy in circumstances
 14 27 that may affect the enrollee's eligibility for that
 14 28 public assistance program, DHS shall review the enrollee's
 14 29 circumstances and respond appropriately.  The bill delineates
 14 30 the appropriate response based upon the response of the
 14 31 enrollee following notice.
 14 32    The bill prohibits DHS from establishing resource limits
 14 33 for the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) that

 15  8    The bill also prohibits DHS from seeking, applying for,
 15  9 accepting, or renewing any waiver of the work requirements
 15 10 applicable to an individual to be eligible for SNAP, unless
 15 11 the individual is exempt under federal law and requires DHS
 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an
 15 18 individual is exempt as specified in the bill, as a condition
 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its

 16 10    A provision of the bill requiring approval of a Medicaid
 16 11 state plan amendment or waiver is to be implemented upon
 16 12 receipt of such federal approval. A provision of the bill not
 16 13 requiring approval of a Medicaid state plan amendment or waiver
 16 14 is to be implemented on January 1, 2019.
 16 15    The bill requires drug testing of applicants for public
 16 16 assistance programs.
 16 17    With the exception of dependent children under the age of

 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.

 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to

 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a
 17  4 numeric=based code assignment (new Code section 234.13A).  A
 17  5 retailer shall not allow a food assistance program recipient
 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food

 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to
 16 24 reapply for assistance for one year.
 16 25    The bill specifies requirements for administering the drug

 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the

 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.
 17  2    The bill requires DHS to maintain a list of eligible
 17  3 food and food items for the food assistance program using a

 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the

 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the

 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a

 15 12 to assign an individual who would otherwise be subject to the
 15 13 work requirements under  federal law, but meets the criteria for
 15 14 one of the exemptions under federal law, to participate in an
 15 15 employment and training program established as prescribed in
 15 16 federal law.
 15 17    The bill also requires DHS to require that, unless an

 15 19 of eligibility for Medicaid, a recipient shall work or
 15 20 participate in a work program or a combination of both for
 15 21 a certain number of hours, volunteer, or participate in the
 15 22 PROMISE JOBS program.
 15 23    The bill provides that if, through the department's
 15 24 activities under the bill, the department discovers potential
 15 25 fraudulent activity, the department shall report its
 15 26 findings and any supportive information to the office of the
 15 27 attorney general for review. The bill requires DHS to adopt
 15 28 administrative rules to administer the bill.
 15 29    The bill requires DHS to submit a report to the governor and
 15 30 the general assembly by January 15, 2019,  and by January 15
 15 31 annually thereafter, detailing the impact of the provisions of

 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value

 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of

 16 19 individual who is an applicant for a public assistance program.
 16 20 The individual is responsible for the cost of the drug test.
 16 21    An applicant who does not participate in the required drug
 16 22 testing is ineligible for public assistance. An individual who
 16 23 has a confirmed positive test result shall be ineligible to

 16 28 result, the dependent child remains eligible for assistance and
 16 29 a protective payee is to be designated by the parent to receive
 16 30 the assistance on behalf of the child.  If a specified relative
 16 31 or other immediate family member declines to be designated, the
 16 32 department must designate the protective payee.  The protective
 16 33 payee is then subject to drug testing before being approved to
 16 34 receive benefits on behalf of the child.  A protective payee
 16 35 with a confirmed positive test result is ineligible to receive
 17  1 assistance on behalf of the child.

 17  6 to use a benefit transfer instrument to purchase food and food
 17  7 items that are not on the eligible food item list.  The bill
 17  8 provides civil penalties for a retailer who violates this
 17  9 provision of the bill.
 17 10    The bill requires DHS to submit a request to the United
 17 11 States department of agriculture for a five=year waiver, pilot
 17 12 project, or other approach for restricting the use of food
 17 13 assistance benefits for food items with a low nutritional value
 17 14 or that cost more than $8 per pound.  The bill requires the
 17 15 request to include a proposal for a thorough process evaluation
 17 16 to document how the restrictions will be implemented by both
 17 17 the state and retailers, with a study design that includes
 17 18 counterfactual data indicating the effects of the absence of
 17 19 such restrictions on food assistance program recipients, and a
 17 20 full cost estimate that addresses both federal and state costs
 17 21 and savings associated with such restrictions.  The department
 17 22 is to submit the request within 90 days of the effective
 17 23 date of the bill.  The bill directs the department to submit
 17 24 regular reports to the chairpersons and ranking members of
 17 25 the general assembly's standing committees on commerce and to
 17 26 the legislative services agency on the status of the request.
 17 27 Implementation of the pilot program is contingent upon receipt
