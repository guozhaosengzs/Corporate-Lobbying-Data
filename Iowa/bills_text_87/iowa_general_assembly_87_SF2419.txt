 13 26    This bill relates to state and local finances by

 13 34 organizations, associations, and conferences; and prohibits
 13 35 certain payments of costs for out=of=state travel and per

 14 15 for county mental health and disabilities services.  The bill
 14 16 restores language from Code section 331.424A(9), Code 2018,

 14 19 county services fund or of the mental health and disabilities
 14 20 services region's cash flow amount attributable to the county,

 14 32 general fund to the cash reserve fund.  The provision is
 14 33 retroactively applicable to May 12, 2017.
 14 34    The bill amends 2018 Iowa Acts, House File 2441, section 17,
 14 35 by striking an applicability provision relating to limitations
 15  1 on guidance issued by the department of education, the state
 15  2 board of education, or the director of the department of

 13 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13 26    This bill relates to state and local finances by
 13 27 making appropriations, providing for legal and regulatory
 13 28 responsibilities, and providing for other properly related
 13 29 matters.  The bill is organized by divisions.

 13 33 2.12; prohibits the payment of annual membership dues for
 13 34 organizations, associations, and conferences; and prohibits

 14 19 county services fund or of the mental health and disabilities
 14 20 services region's cash flow amount attributable to the county,

 14 30 reserve fund to the general fund of the state to make

 14 32 general fund to the cash reserve fund.  The provision is
 14 33 retroactively applicable to May 12, 2017.
 14 34    The bill amends 2018 Iowa Acts, House File 2441, section 17,
 14 35 by striking an applicability provision relating to limitations
 15  1 on guidance issued by the department of education, the state
 15  2 board of education, or the director of the department of

 13 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13 26    This bill relates to state and local finances by
 13 27 making appropriations, providing for legal and regulatory
 13 28 responsibilities, and providing for other properly related
 13 29 matters.  The bill is organized by divisions.
 13 30    STANDING APPROPRIATIONS AND RELATED MATTERS.  The division

 13 32 made for expenses of the general assembly under Code section
 13 33 2.12; prohibits the payment of annual membership dues for
 13 34 organizations, associations, and conferences; and prohibits
 13 35 certain payments of costs for out=of=state travel and per

 14  8    The bill requires the salary model administrator to work in
 14  9 conjunction with the legislative services agency to maintain
 14 10 the state's salary model used for analyzing, comparing, and
 14 11 projecting state salary and benefit information.

 14 15 for county mental health and disabilities services.  The bill
 14 16 restores language from Code section 331.424A(9), Code 2018,

 14 19 county services fund or of the mental health and disabilities
 14 20 services region's cash flow amount attributable to the county,
 14 21 an amount equal to the county's cash flow reduction amount

 14 25 service system management plan and shall result in a reduction
 14 26 of the county budgeted amount. The bill also establishes
 14 27 a similar county cash flow reduction amount provision for
 14 28 counties that join a different region.
 14 29    The bill amends an FY 2016=2017 transfer from the cash
 14 30 reserve fund to the general fund of the state to make
 14 31 inapplicable a conditional standing appropriation from the
 14 32 general fund to the cash reserve fund.  The provision is
 14 33 retroactively applicable to May 12, 2017.
 14 34    The bill amends 2018 Iowa Acts, House File 2441, section 17,
 14 35 by striking an applicability provision relating to limitations
 15  1 on guidance issued by the department of education, the state
 15  2 board of education, or the director of the department of

 13 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13 26    This bill relates to state and local finances by

 14 20 services region's cash flow amount attributable to the county,

 14 33 retroactively applicable to May 12, 2017.
 14 34    The bill amends 2018 Iowa Acts, House File 2441, section 17,
 14 35 by striking an applicability provision relating to limitations
 15  1 on guidance issued by the department of education, the state

 13 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 13 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 13 26    This bill relates to state and local finances by

 13 28 responsibilities, and providing for other properly related
 13 29 matters.  The bill is organized by divisions.

 14 15 for county mental health and disabilities services.  The bill
 14 16 restores language from Code section 331.424A(9), Code 2018,

 14 19 county services fund or of the mental health and disabilities
 14 20 services region's cash flow amount attributable to the county,

 14 29    The bill amends an FY 2016=2017 transfer from the cash
 14 30 reserve fund to the general fund of the state to make
 14 31 inapplicable a conditional standing appropriation from the
 14 32 general fund to the cash reserve fund.  The provision is
 14 33 retroactively applicable to May 12, 2017.
 14 34    The bill amends 2018 Iowa Acts, House File 2441, section 17,
 14 35 by striking an applicability provision relating to limitations
 15  1 on guidance issued by the department of education, the state
 15  2 board of education, or the director of the department of

 15  6 emergency fund to the general fund of the state to change the
