  3 21 building, electrical, or public right=of=way use permit for
  3 22 the siting of a small wireless facility to the extent that
  3 23 such permit is of general applicability and does not deny
  3 24 access by the small wireless facility to a public right=of=way.
  3 25 Notwithstanding this paragraph, an authority shall not require
  3 26 a person to obtain a permit for the routine maintenance of a
  3 27 previously approved small wireless facility or the replacement
  3 28 of a previously approved small wireless facility with a
  3 29 facility of substantially similar height, weight, and wind
  3 30 and structural loading, provided, however, that an authority
  3 31 may require a person to obtain a permit to work in a public
  3 32 right=of=way with the same terms and conditions provided for
  3 33 other commercial projects or uses in the public right=of=way.
  3 34    b.  An authority shall not require a person to apply for or
  3 35 enter into an individual license, franchise, or other agreement
  4  1 with the authority or any other entity for the siting of a
  4  2 small wireless facility on a utility pole located on a public
  4  3 right=of=way or authority property, except that an authority
  4  4 may establish nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral and
  4  5 commercially reasonable rates, terms, and conditions set forth
  4  6 in a building permit obtained pursuant to this subsection which
  4  7 shall comply with the federal pole attachment requirements
  4  8 provided in 47 U.S.C. {224 and any regulations promulgated
  4  9 thereunder.
  4 10    c.  (1)  A new, replacement, or modified utility pole or

 10  8                           EXPLANATION
 10  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 11    This bill authorizes the siting of small wireless facilities
 10 12 and the joint financing of telecommunications facilities.
 10 13     Code chapter 8C provides a series of uniform rules and
 10 14 limitations for the deployment of and applications for wireless
 10 15 communications facilities and infrastructure. The bill adds
 10 16 specific rules and limitations for the application for and
 10 17 deployment of small wireless facilities.
 10 18    The bill amends the definition of "authority" in Code
 10 19 section 8C.2 to exclude municipally owned utilities established
 10 20 under Title IX, subtitle 4 of the Code that do not have zoning
 10 21 or permitting authority with respect to the siting of small
 10 22 wireless facilities. The bill defines "siting" to mean the
 10 23 mounting, installation, maintenance, modification, operation,
 10 24 or replacement of a small wireless facility on or adjacent to
 10 25 an existing utility pole or other structure, a replacement
 10 26 utility pole, or a new utility pole. The bill defines "small
 10 27 wireless facility" as a wireless facility where each antenna is
 10 28 no more than six cubic feet in volume and all other equipment,
 10 29 except for certain equipment described in the bill, is
 10 30 cumulatively no more than 28 cubic feet in volume, as measured
 10 31 by its external displacement. A "small wireless facility" does
 10 32 not include any structure that supports or houses equipment.
 10 33 The bill amends the definition of "utility pole" in Code
 10 34 section 8C.2 to include wireless service. The bill defines
 10 35 "wireless facility" to mean equipment at a fixed location
 11  1 that enables the transmission of wireless communications
 11  2 and information of any kind between user equipment and a
 11  3 communications network. The bill defines "wireless service" to
 11  4 mean any fixed or mobile service using licensed or unlicensed
 11  5 wireless spectrum and provided by a wireless facility. The
 11  6 bill defines "wireless service provider" to mean a provider of
 11  7 wireless service.
 11  8    The bill prohibits an authority from restricting the siting
 11  9 of small wireless facilities. An authority with planning
 11 10 and zoning regulations shall authorize such facilities in
 11 11 zoning districts where the facilities are located on public
 11 12 rights=of=way or authority property, or where the facilities
 11 13 are sited on certain existing structures. Facilities not sited
 11 14 on such property or sited in such a manner may be classified as
 11 15 special or conditional uses. An authority may also require a
 11 16 person to obtain a special or conditional land use permit to
 11 17 install new utility poles or wireless support structures on
 11 18 certain property.
 11 19    The bill provides that an authority may require a person
 11 20 to obtain building, electrical, or public way use permits for
 11 21 the siting of small wireless facilities if such permit is of
 11 22 general applicability and does not deny a facility access to
 11 23 a public right=of=way. However, an authority cannot require
 11 24 a person to obtain a permit for the routine maintenance or
 11 25 replacement of a previously approved facility unless such
 11 26 permit contains the same terms and conditions provided for
 11 27 other commercial projects or uses in the public right=of=way.
 11 28    The bill prohibits an authority from requiring a person to
 11 29 enter into an individual license, franchise, or other agreement
 11 30 with the authority for the siting of small wireless facilities
 11 31 on utility poles located on public rights=of=way or authority
 11 32 property, subject to nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral
 11 33 and commercially reasonable terms and conditions provided in
 11 34 a building permit obtained pursuant to the bill and which
 11 35 complies with federal pole attachment requirements.
 12  1 The bill provides that a new, replacement, or modified
 12  2 utility pole or wireless support structure installed in
 12  3 the public right=of=way for the siting of a small wireless
 12  4 facility shall not exceed the greater of 10 feet in height
 12  5 above the tallest utility pole existing on or before July
 12  6 1, 2017, located within 500 feet of the new or replacement
 12  7 utility pole in the same public right=of=way, or 50 feet in
 12  8 height above ground level. However, a person may construct,
 12  9 modify, or maintain a utility pole along, across, and
 12 10 under a public right=of=way in excess of such size limits,
 12 11 subject to applicable zoning regulations and compliance with
 12 12 nondiscriminatory undergrounding requirements.
 12 13    The bill provides a series of rules and limitations
 12 14 applicable to an application for a permit. The rules and
 12 15 limitations include prohibiting requiring certain information
 12 16 from or about an applicant, limiting the amount of application
 12 17 fees for processing or issuing a permit, time frames within
 12 18 which an authority must approve or deny a permit application,
 12 19 standards for the denial of a permit application, prohibiting
 12 20 the imposition of a moratorium on the processing or issuance of
 12 21 permits, and prohibiting the processing or issuance of permits
 12 22 on a discriminatory basis, as specified in the bill.
 12 23    The bill provides that the annual recurring rate charged
 12 24 by an authority for the siting of small wireless facilities
 12 25 on utility poles cannot exceed the rate computed for
 12 26 telecommunications pole attachments pursuant to federal law.
 12 27    The bill provides that an authority must authorize the
 12 28 siting of small wireless facilities on wireless support
 12 29 structures not located within public rights=of=way to the
 12 30 same extent the authority permits access for other commercial
 12 31 projects or uses, and may authorize the siting even if the
 12 32 authority has not previously permitted access. The annual
 12 33 recurring rate for such siting cannot exceed the least of the
 12 34 amount charged for a similar project on similar property,
 12 35 the projected cost to the authority for the siting, or $100,
 13  1 adjusted every five years to reflect changes in the consumer
 13  2 price index.
 13  3    The bill provides that a party aggrieved by the final action
 13  4 or inaction of an authority may bring an action for review in
 13  5 any court of competent jurisdiction.
 13  6    The bill provides that a public utility that owns or
 13  7 controls a utility pole to which a small wireless facility
 13  8 is sited in alleged violation of the Iowa electrical safety
 13  9 code or any other applicable law must notify the owner of
 13 10 the small wireless facility of the violation, which must
 13 11 include the location of the alleged violation, a description
 13 12 of the alleged violation, and suggested corrective action.
 13 13 The owner of the small wireless facility must respond to the
 13 14 public utility within 60 days, which must include a statement
 13 15 as to whether the person is the owner of the small wireless
 13 16 facility in dispute, a statement as to whether the owner
 13 17 disputes the violation, a plan for corrective action if the
 13 18 owner does not dispute the violation, and a statement as to
 13 19 whether the violation has been corrected. The owner must take
 13 20 corrective action to correct an alleged violation within 180
 13 21 days after receiving notice of the alleged violation, unless
 13 22 good cause is shown that a delay is appropriate, as specified
 13 23 in the bill. The bill provides that either party may file

 10  8                           EXPLANATION
 10  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 11    This bill authorizes the siting of small wireless facilities
 10 12 and the joint financing of telecommunications facilities.
 10 13     Code chapter 8C provides a series of uniform rules and
 10 14 limitations for the deployment of and applications for wireless
 10 15 communications facilities and infrastructure. The bill adds
 10 16 specific rules and limitations for the application for and
 10 17 deployment of small wireless facilities.
 10 18    The bill amends the definition of "authority" in Code
 10 19 section 8C.2 to exclude municipally owned utilities established
 10 20 under Title IX, subtitle 4 of the Code that do not have zoning
 10 21 or permitting authority with respect to the siting of small
 10 22 wireless facilities. The bill defines "siting" to mean the
 10 23 mounting, installation, maintenance, modification, operation,
 10 24 or replacement of a small wireless facility on or adjacent to
 10 25 an existing utility pole or other structure, a replacement
 10 26 utility pole, or a new utility pole. The bill defines "small
 10 27 wireless facility" as a wireless facility where each antenna is
 10 28 no more than six cubic feet in volume and all other equipment,
 10 29 except for certain equipment described in the bill, is
 10 30 cumulatively no more than 28 cubic feet in volume, as measured
 10 31 by its external displacement. A "small wireless facility" does
 10 32 not include any structure that supports or houses equipment.
 10 33 The bill amends the definition of "utility pole" in Code
 10 34 section 8C.2 to include wireless service. The bill defines
 10 35 "wireless facility" to mean equipment at a fixed location
 11  1 that enables the transmission of wireless communications
 11  2 and information of any kind between user equipment and a
 11  3 communications network. The bill defines "wireless service" to
 11  4 mean any fixed or mobile service using licensed or unlicensed
 11  5 wireless spectrum and provided by a wireless facility. The
 11  6 bill defines "wireless service provider" to mean a provider of
 11  7 wireless service.
 11  8    The bill prohibits an authority from restricting the siting
 11  9 of small wireless facilities. An authority with planning
 11 10 and zoning regulations shall authorize such facilities in
 11 11 zoning districts where the facilities are located on public
 11 12 rights=of=way or authority property, or where the facilities
 11 13 are sited on certain existing structures. Facilities not sited
 11 14 on such property or sited in such a manner may be classified as
 11 15 special or conditional uses. An authority may also require a
 11 16 person to obtain a special or conditional land use permit to
 11 17 install new utility poles or wireless support structures on
 11 18 certain property.
 11 19    The bill provides that an authority may require a person
 11 20 to obtain building, electrical, or public way use permits for
 11 21 the siting of small wireless facilities if such permit is of
 11 22 general applicability and does not deny a facility access to
 11 23 a public right=of=way. However, an authority cannot require
 11 24 a person to obtain a permit for the routine maintenance or
 11 25 replacement of a previously approved facility unless such
 11 26 permit contains the same terms and conditions provided for
 11 27 other commercial projects or uses in the public right=of=way.
 11 28    The bill prohibits an authority from requiring a person to
 11 29 enter into an individual license, franchise, or other agreement
 11 30 with the authority for the siting of small wireless facilities
 11 31 on utility poles located on public rights=of=way or authority
 11 32 property, subject to nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral
 11 33 and commercially reasonable terms and conditions provided in
 11 34 a building permit obtained pursuant to the bill and which
 11 35 complies with federal pole attachment requirements.
 12  1 The bill provides that a new, replacement, or modified
 12  2 utility pole or wireless support structure installed in
 12  3 the public right=of=way for the siting of a small wireless
 12  4 facility shall not exceed the greater of 10 feet in height
 12  5 above the tallest utility pole existing on or before July
 12  6 1, 2017, located within 500 feet of the new or replacement
 12  7 utility pole in the same public right=of=way, or 50 feet in
 12  8 height above ground level. However, a person may construct,
 12  9 modify, or maintain a utility pole along, across, and
 12 10 under a public right=of=way in excess of such size limits,
 12 11 subject to applicable zoning regulations and compliance with
 12 12 nondiscriminatory undergrounding requirements.
 12 13    The bill provides a series of rules and limitations
 12 14 applicable to an application for a permit. The rules and
 12 15 limitations include prohibiting requiring certain information
 12 16 from or about an applicant, limiting the amount of application
 12 17 fees for processing or issuing a permit, time frames within
 12 18 which an authority must approve or deny a permit application,
 12 19 standards for the denial of a permit application, prohibiting
 12 20 the imposition of a moratorium on the processing or issuance of
 12 21 permits, and prohibiting the processing or issuance of permits
 12 22 on a discriminatory basis, as specified in the bill.
 12 23    The bill provides that the annual recurring rate charged
 12 24 by an authority for the siting of small wireless facilities
 12 25 on utility poles cannot exceed the rate computed for
 12 26 telecommunications pole attachments pursuant to federal law.
 12 27    The bill provides that an authority must authorize the
 12 28 siting of small wireless facilities on wireless support
 12 29 structures not located within public rights=of=way to the
 12 30 same extent the authority permits access for other commercial
 12 31 projects or uses, and may authorize the siting even if the
 12 32 authority has not previously permitted access. The annual
 12 33 recurring rate for such siting cannot exceed the least of the
 12 34 amount charged for a similar project on similar property,
 12 35 the projected cost to the authority for the siting, or $100,
 13  1 adjusted every five years to reflect changes in the consumer
 13  2 price index.
 13  3    The bill provides that a party aggrieved by the final action
 13  4 or inaction of an authority may bring an action for review in
 13  5 any court of competent jurisdiction.
 13  6    The bill provides that a public utility that owns or
 13  7 controls a utility pole to which a small wireless facility
 13  8 is sited in alleged violation of the Iowa electrical safety
 13  9 code or any other applicable law must notify the owner of
 13 10 the small wireless facility of the violation, which must
 13 11 include the location of the alleged violation, a description
 13 12 of the alleged violation, and suggested corrective action.
 13 13 The owner of the small wireless facility must respond to the
 13 14 public utility within 60 days, which must include a statement
 13 15 as to whether the person is the owner of the small wireless
 13 16 facility in dispute, a statement as to whether the owner
 13 17 disputes the violation, a plan for corrective action if the
 13 18 owner does not dispute the violation, and a statement as to
 13 19 whether the violation has been corrected. The owner must take
 13 20 corrective action to correct an alleged violation within 180
 13 21 days after receiving notice of the alleged violation, unless
 13 22 good cause is shown that a delay is appropriate, as specified
 13 23 in the bill. The bill provides that either party may file
 13 24 an action concerning an alleged violation in the appropriate
 13 25 district court for injunctive relief or any other appropriate
 13 26 remedy, including the removal of a small wireless facility,
 13 27 if the parties cannot resolve the dispute after following the
 13 28 procedures provided in the bill.
 13 29    The bill amends Code section 8C.9 to repeal Code chapter 8C
 13 30 on July 1, 2022, instead of on July 1, 2020.
 13 31    Code chapter 28F provides for the joint financing by public

 12 27    The bill provides that an authority must authorize the
 12 28 siting of small wireless facilities on wireless support
 12 29 structures not located within public rights=of=way to the
 12 30 same extent the authority permits access for other commercial
 12 31 projects or uses, and may authorize the siting even if the
 12 32 authority has not previously permitted access. The annual
 12 33 recurring rate for such siting cannot exceed the least of the
 12 34 amount charged for a similar project on similar property,
 12 35 the projected cost to the authority for the siting, or $100,

 13  7 controls a utility pole to which a small wireless facility
 13  8 is sited in alleged violation of the Iowa electrical safety
 13  9 code or any other applicable law must notify the owner of
 13 10 the small wireless facility of the violation, which must
 13 11 include the location of the alleged violation, a description
 13 12 of the alleged violation, and suggested corrective action.
 13 13 The owner of the small wireless facility must respond to the

 13 15 as to whether the person is the owner of the small wireless
 13 16 facility in dispute, a statement as to whether the owner
 13 17 disputes the violation, a plan for corrective action if the
 13 18 owner does not dispute the violation, and a statement as to
 13 19 whether the violation has been corrected. The owner must take
 13 20 corrective action to correct an alleged violation within 180
 13 21 days after receiving notice of the alleged violation, unless
 13 22 good cause is shown that a delay is appropriate, as specified
 13 23 in the bill. The bill provides that either party may file
 13 24 an action concerning an alleged violation in the appropriate
 13 25 district court for injunctive relief or any other appropriate
 13 26 remedy, including the removal of a small wireless facility,

 10  8                           EXPLANATION
 10  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 11    This bill authorizes the siting of small wireless facilities
 10 12 and the joint financing of telecommunications facilities.
 10 13     Code chapter 8C provides a series of uniform rules and
 10 14 limitations for the deployment of and applications for wireless
 10 15 communications facilities and infrastructure. The bill adds
 10 16 specific rules and limitations for the application for and
 10 17 deployment of small wireless facilities.
 10 18    The bill amends the definition of "authority" in Code
 10 19 section 8C.2 to exclude municipally owned utilities established
 10 20 under Title IX, subtitle 4 of the Code that do not have zoning
 10 21 or permitting authority with respect to the siting of small
 10 22 wireless facilities. The bill defines "siting" to mean the
 10 23 mounting, installation, maintenance, modification, operation,
 10 24 or replacement of a small wireless facility on or adjacent to
 10 25 an existing utility pole or other structure, a replacement
 10 26 utility pole, or a new utility pole. The bill defines "small
 10 27 wireless facility" as a wireless facility where each antenna is
 10 28 no more than six cubic feet in volume and all other equipment,
 10 29 except for certain equipment described in the bill, is
 10 30 cumulatively no more than 28 cubic feet in volume, as measured
 10 31 by its external displacement. A "small wireless facility" does
 10 32 not include any structure that supports or houses equipment.
 10 33 The bill amends the definition of "utility pole" in Code
 10 34 section 8C.2 to include wireless service. The bill defines
 10 35 "wireless facility" to mean equipment at a fixed location
 11  1 that enables the transmission of wireless communications
 11  2 and information of any kind between user equipment and a
 11  3 communications network. The bill defines "wireless service" to
 11  4 mean any fixed or mobile service using licensed or unlicensed
 11  5 wireless spectrum and provided by a wireless facility. The
 11  6 bill defines "wireless service provider" to mean a provider of
 11  7 wireless service.
 11  8    The bill prohibits an authority from restricting the siting
 11  9 of small wireless facilities. An authority with planning
 11 10 and zoning regulations shall authorize such facilities in
 11 11 zoning districts where the facilities are located on public
 11 12 rights=of=way or authority property, or where the facilities
 11 13 are sited on certain existing structures. Facilities not sited
 11 14 on such property or sited in such a manner may be classified as
 11 15 special or conditional uses. An authority may also require a
 11 16 person to obtain a special or conditional land use permit to
 11 17 install new utility poles or wireless support structures on
 11 18 certain property.
 11 19    The bill provides that an authority may require a person
 11 20 to obtain building, electrical, or public way use permits for
 11 21 the siting of small wireless facilities if such permit is of
 11 22 general applicability and does not deny a facility access to
 11 23 a public right=of=way. However, an authority cannot require
 11 24 a person to obtain a permit for the routine maintenance or
 11 25 replacement of a previously approved facility unless such
 11 26 permit contains the same terms and conditions provided for
 11 27 other commercial projects or uses in the public right=of=way.
 11 28    The bill prohibits an authority from requiring a person to
 11 29 enter into an individual license, franchise, or other agreement
 11 30 with the authority for the siting of small wireless facilities
 11 31 on utility poles located on public rights=of=way or authority
 11 32 property, subject to nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral
 11 33 and commercially reasonable terms and conditions provided in
 11 34 a building permit obtained pursuant to the bill and which
 11 35 complies with federal pole attachment requirements.
 12  1 The bill provides that a new, replacement, or modified
 12  2 utility pole or wireless support structure installed in
 12  3 the public right=of=way for the siting of a small wireless
 12  4 facility shall not exceed the greater of 10 feet in height
 12  5 above the tallest utility pole existing on or before July
 12  6 1, 2017, located within 500 feet of the new or replacement
 12  7 utility pole in the same public right=of=way, or 50 feet in
 12  8 height above ground level. However, a person may construct,
 12  9 modify, or maintain a utility pole along, across, and
 12 10 under a public right=of=way in excess of such size limits,
 12 11 subject to applicable zoning regulations and compliance with
 12 12 nondiscriminatory undergrounding requirements.
 12 13    The bill provides a series of rules and limitations
 12 14 applicable to an application for a permit. The rules and
 12 15 limitations include prohibiting requiring certain information
 12 16 from or about an applicant, limiting the amount of application
 12 17 fees for processing or issuing a permit, time frames within
 12 18 which an authority must approve or deny a permit application,
 12 19 standards for the denial of a permit application, prohibiting
 12 20 the imposition of a moratorium on the processing or issuance of
 12 21 permits, and prohibiting the processing or issuance of permits
 12 22 on a discriminatory basis, as specified in the bill.
 12 23    The bill provides that the annual recurring rate charged
 12 24 by an authority for the siting of small wireless facilities
 12 25 on utility poles cannot exceed the rate computed for
 12 26 telecommunications pole attachments pursuant to federal law.
 12 27    The bill provides that an authority must authorize the
 12 28 siting of small wireless facilities on wireless support
 12 29 structures not located within public rights=of=way to the

 12  1 The bill provides that a new, replacement, or modified
 12  2 utility pole or wireless support structure installed in
 12  3 the public right=of=way for the siting of a small wireless
 12  4 facility shall not exceed the greater of 10 feet in height
 12  5 above the tallest utility pole existing on or before July
 12  6 1, 2017, located within 500 feet of the new or replacement
 12  7 utility pole in the same public right=of=way, or 50 feet in
 12  8 height above ground level. However, a person may construct,
 12  9 modify, or maintain a utility pole along, across, and
 12 10 under a public right=of=way in excess of such size limits,
 12 11 subject to applicable zoning regulations and compliance with
 12 12 nondiscriminatory undergrounding requirements.
 12 13    The bill provides a series of rules and limitations
 12 14 applicable to an application for a permit. The rules and

 12 28 siting of small wireless facilities on wireless support
 12 29 structures not located within public rights=of=way to the
 12 30 same extent the authority permits access for other commercial
 12 31 projects or uses, and may authorize the siting even if the
 12 32 authority has not previously permitted access. The annual
 12 33 recurring rate for such siting cannot exceed the least of the
 12 34 amount charged for a similar project on similar property,
 12 35 the projected cost to the authority for the siting, or $100,
 13  1 adjusted every five years to reflect changes in the consumer
 13  2 price index.
 13  3    The bill provides that a party aggrieved by the final action
 13  4 or inaction of an authority may bring an action for review in
 13  5 any court of competent jurisdiction.

 13 10 the small wireless facility of the violation, which must
 13 11 include the location of the alleged violation, a description
 13 12 of the alleged violation, and suggested corrective action.
 13 13 The owner of the small wireless facility must respond to the
 13 14 public utility within 60 days, which must include a statement
 13 15 as to whether the person is the owner of the small wireless
 13 16 facility in dispute, a statement as to whether the owner
 13 17 disputes the violation, a plan for corrective action if the
 13 18 owner does not dispute the violation, and a statement as to
 13 19 whether the violation has been corrected. The owner must take
 13 20 corrective action to correct an alleged violation within 180
 13 21 days after receiving notice of the alleged violation, unless
 13 22 good cause is shown that a delay is appropriate, as specified
 13 23 in the bill. The bill provides that either party may file
 13 24 an action concerning an alleged violation in the appropriate
 13 25 district court for injunctive relief or any other appropriate
 13 26 remedy, including the removal of a small wireless facility,
 13 27 if the parties cannot resolve the dispute after following the
 13 28 procedures provided in the bill.

 10  8                           EXPLANATION
 10  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 11    This bill authorizes the siting of small wireless facilities
 10 12 and the joint financing of telecommunications facilities.
 10 13     Code chapter 8C provides a series of uniform rules and
 10 14 limitations for the deployment of and applications for wireless
 10 15 communications facilities and infrastructure. The bill adds
 10 16 specific rules and limitations for the application for and
 10 17 deployment of small wireless facilities.
 10 18    The bill amends the definition of "authority" in Code
 10 19 section 8C.2 to exclude municipally owned utilities established
 10 20 under Title IX, subtitle 4 of the Code that do not have zoning
 10 21 or permitting authority with respect to the siting of small
 10 22 wireless facilities. The bill defines "siting" to mean the
 10 23 mounting, installation, maintenance, modification, operation,
 10 24 or replacement of a small wireless facility on or adjacent to
 10 25 an existing utility pole or other structure, a replacement
 10 26 utility pole, or a new utility pole. The bill defines "small
 10 27 wireless facility" as a wireless facility where each antenna is
 10 28 no more than six cubic feet in volume and all other equipment,
 10 29 except for certain equipment described in the bill, is
 10 30 cumulatively no more than 28 cubic feet in volume, as measured
 10 31 by its external displacement. A "small wireless facility" does
 10 32 not include any structure that supports or houses equipment.
 10 33 The bill amends the definition of "utility pole" in Code
 10 34 section 8C.2 to include wireless service. The bill defines
 10 35 "wireless facility" to mean equipment at a fixed location
 11  1 that enables the transmission of wireless communications
 11  2 and information of any kind between user equipment and a
 11  3 communications network. The bill defines "wireless service" to
 11  4 mean any fixed or mobile service using licensed or unlicensed
 11  5 wireless spectrum and provided by a wireless facility. The
 11  6 bill defines "wireless service provider" to mean a provider of
 11  7 wireless service.
 11  8    The bill prohibits an authority from restricting the siting
 11  9 of small wireless facilities. An authority with planning
 11 10 and zoning regulations shall authorize such facilities in
 11 11 zoning districts where the facilities are located on public
 11 12 rights=of=way or authority property, or where the facilities
 11 13 are sited on certain existing structures. Facilities not sited
 11 14 on such property or sited in such a manner may be classified as
 11 15 special or conditional uses. An authority may also require a
 11 16 person to obtain a special or conditional land use permit to
 11 17 install new utility poles or wireless support structures on
 11 18 certain property.
 11 19    The bill provides that an authority may require a person
 11 20 to obtain building, electrical, or public way use permits for
 11 21 the siting of small wireless facilities if such permit is of
 11 22 general applicability and does not deny a facility access to
 11 23 a public right=of=way. However, an authority cannot require
 11 24 a person to obtain a permit for the routine maintenance or
 11 25 replacement of a previously approved facility unless such
 11 26 permit contains the same terms and conditions provided for
 11 27 other commercial projects or uses in the public right=of=way.
 11 28    The bill prohibits an authority from requiring a person to
 11 29 enter into an individual license, franchise, or other agreement
 11 30 with the authority for the siting of small wireless facilities
 11 31 on utility poles located on public rights=of=way or authority
 11 32 property, subject to nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral
 11 33 and commercially reasonable terms and conditions provided in
 11 34 a building permit obtained pursuant to the bill and which
 11 35 complies with federal pole attachment requirements.
 12  1 The bill provides that a new, replacement, or modified
 12  2 utility pole or wireless support structure installed in
 12  3 the public right=of=way for the siting of a small wireless
 12  4 facility shall not exceed the greater of 10 feet in height

 11 20 to obtain building, electrical, or public way use permits for
 11 21 the siting of small wireless facilities if such permit is of
 11 22 general applicability and does not deny a facility access to
 11 23 a public right=of=way. However, an authority cannot require
 11 24 a person to obtain a permit for the routine maintenance or
 11 25 replacement of a previously approved facility unless such
 11 26 permit contains the same terms and conditions provided for
 11 27 other commercial projects or uses in the public right=of=way.
 11 28    The bill prohibits an authority from requiring a person to
 11 29 enter into an individual license, franchise, or other agreement
 11 30 with the authority for the siting of small wireless facilities
 11 31 on utility poles located on public rights=of=way or authority
 11 32 property, subject to nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral
 11 33 and commercially reasonable terms and conditions provided in
 11 34 a building permit obtained pursuant to the bill and which
 11 35 complies with federal pole attachment requirements.
 12  1 The bill provides that a new, replacement, or modified
 12  2 utility pole or wireless support structure installed in
 12  3 the public right=of=way for the siting of a small wireless
 12  4 facility shall not exceed the greater of 10 feet in height
 12  5 above the tallest utility pole existing on or before July
 12  6 1, 2017, located within 500 feet of the new or replacement
 12  7 utility pole in the same public right=of=way, or 50 feet in
 12  8 height above ground level. However, a person may construct,
 12  9 modify, or maintain a utility pole along, across, and
 12 10 under a public right=of=way in excess of such size limits,
 12 11 subject to applicable zoning regulations and compliance with
 12 12 nondiscriminatory undergrounding requirements.
 12 13    The bill provides a series of rules and limitations
 12 14 applicable to an application for a permit. The rules and
 12 15 limitations include prohibiting requiring certain information
 12 16 from or about an applicant, limiting the amount of application
 12 17 fees for processing or issuing a permit, time frames within
 12 18 which an authority must approve or deny a permit application,
 12 19 standards for the denial of a permit application, prohibiting
 12 20 the imposition of a moratorium on the processing or issuance of
 12 21 permits, and prohibiting the processing or issuance of permits
 12 22 on a discriminatory basis, as specified in the bill.

 12 28 siting of small wireless facilities on wireless support
 12 29 structures not located within public rights=of=way to the
 12 30 same extent the authority permits access for other commercial
 12 31 projects or uses, and may authorize the siting even if the
 12 32 authority has not previously permitted access. The annual
 12 33 recurring rate for such siting cannot exceed the least of the
 12 34 amount charged for a similar project on similar property,
 12 35 the projected cost to the authority for the siting, or $100,
 13  1 adjusted every five years to reflect changes in the consumer
 13  2 price index.
 13  3    The bill provides that a party aggrieved by the final action
 13  4 or inaction of an authority may bring an action for review in
 13  5 any court of competent jurisdiction.
 13  6    The bill provides that a public utility that owns or
 13  7 controls a utility pole to which a small wireless facility
 13  8 is sited in alleged violation of the Iowa electrical safety
 13  9 code or any other applicable law must notify the owner of
 13 10 the small wireless facility of the violation, which must
 13 11 include the location of the alleged violation, a description
 13 12 of the alleged violation, and suggested corrective action.
 13 13 The owner of the small wireless facility must respond to the
 13 14 public utility within 60 days, which must include a statement
 13 15 as to whether the person is the owner of the small wireless
 13 16 facility in dispute, a statement as to whether the owner
 13 17 disputes the violation, a plan for corrective action if the
 13 18 owner does not dispute the violation, and a statement as to
 13 19 whether the violation has been corrected. The owner must take
 13 20 corrective action to correct an alleged violation within 180
 13 21 days after receiving notice of the alleged violation, unless
 13 22 good cause is shown that a delay is appropriate, as specified
 13 23 in the bill. The bill provides that either party may file
 13 24 an action concerning an alleged violation in the appropriate
 13 25 district court for injunctive relief or any other appropriate
 13 26 remedy, including the removal of a small wireless facility,
 13 27 if the parties cannot resolve the dispute after following the
 13 28 procedures provided in the bill.
 13 29    The bill amends Code section 8C.9 to repeal Code chapter 8C
 13 30 on July 1, 2022, instead of on July 1, 2020.
 13 31    Code chapter 28F provides for the joint financing by public
 13 32 agencies of certain public works and facilities. The bill
 13 33 amends Code section 28F.1 to include works or facilities
 13 34 useful for the operation of a telecommunications system or
 13 35 the provision of telecommunications services in the list of
 14  1 specified facilities subject to joint financing by public

 10  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 11    This bill authorizes the siting of small wireless facilities
 10 12 and the joint financing of telecommunications facilities.
 10 13     Code chapter 8C provides a series of uniform rules and
 10 14 limitations for the deployment of and applications for wireless
 10 15 communications facilities and infrastructure. The bill adds
 10 16 specific rules and limitations for the application for and
 10 17 deployment of small wireless facilities.
 10 18    The bill amends the definition of "authority" in Code
 10 19 section 8C.2 to exclude municipally owned utilities established
 10 20 under Title IX, subtitle 4 of the Code that do not have zoning
 10 21 or permitting authority with respect to the siting of small
 10 22 wireless facilities. The bill defines "siting" to mean the
 10 23 mounting, installation, maintenance, modification, operation,
 10 24 or replacement of a small wireless facility on or adjacent to
 10 25 an existing utility pole or other structure, a replacement
 10 26 utility pole, or a new utility pole. The bill defines "small
 10 27 wireless facility" as a wireless facility where each antenna is
 10 28 no more than six cubic feet in volume and all other equipment,
 10 29 except for certain equipment described in the bill, is
 10 30 cumulatively no more than 28 cubic feet in volume, as measured
 10 31 by its external displacement. A "small wireless facility" does
 10 32 not include any structure that supports or houses equipment.
 10 33 The bill amends the definition of "utility pole" in Code
 10 34 section 8C.2 to include wireless service. The bill defines
 10 35 "wireless facility" to mean equipment at a fixed location
 11  1 that enables the transmission of wireless communications
 11  2 and information of any kind between user equipment and a
 11  3 communications network. The bill defines "wireless service" to
 11  4 mean any fixed or mobile service using licensed or unlicensed
 11  5 wireless spectrum and provided by a wireless facility. The
 11  6 bill defines "wireless service provider" to mean a provider of
 11  7 wireless service.
 11  8    The bill prohibits an authority from restricting the siting
 11  9 of small wireless facilities. An authority with planning
 11 10 and zoning regulations shall authorize such facilities in
 11 11 zoning districts where the facilities are located on public
 11 12 rights=of=way or authority property, or where the facilities
 11 13 are sited on certain existing structures. Facilities not sited
 11 14 on such property or sited in such a manner may be classified as
 11 15 special or conditional uses. An authority may also require a
 11 16 person to obtain a special or conditional land use permit to
 11 17 install new utility poles or wireless support structures on
 11 18 certain property.
 11 19    The bill provides that an authority may require a person
 11 20 to obtain building, electrical, or public way use permits for
 11 21 the siting of small wireless facilities if such permit is of
 11 22 general applicability and does not deny a facility access to
 11 23 a public right=of=way. However, an authority cannot require
 11 24 a person to obtain a permit for the routine maintenance or
 11 25 replacement of a previously approved facility unless such
 11 26 permit contains the same terms and conditions provided for
 11 27 other commercial projects or uses in the public right=of=way.
 11 28    The bill prohibits an authority from requiring a person to
 11 29 enter into an individual license, franchise, or other agreement
 11 30 with the authority for the siting of small wireless facilities

 11 13 are sited on certain existing structures. Facilities not sited
 11 14 on such property or sited in such a manner may be classified as
 11 15 special or conditional uses. An authority may also require a
 11 16 person to obtain a special or conditional land use permit to
 11 17 install new utility poles or wireless support structures on
 11 18 certain property.
 11 19    The bill provides that an authority may require a person
 11 20 to obtain building, electrical, or public way use permits for
 11 21 the siting of small wireless facilities if such permit is of
 11 22 general applicability and does not deny a facility access to
 11 23 a public right=of=way. However, an authority cannot require
 11 24 a person to obtain a permit for the routine maintenance or
 11 25 replacement of a previously approved facility unless such
 11 26 permit contains the same terms and conditions provided for
 11 27 other commercial projects or uses in the public right=of=way.
 11 28    The bill prohibits an authority from requiring a person to
 11 29 enter into an individual license, franchise, or other agreement
 11 30 with the authority for the siting of small wireless facilities
 11 31 on utility poles located on public rights=of=way or authority
 11 32 property, subject to nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral
 11 33 and commercially reasonable terms and conditions provided in
 11 34 a building permit obtained pursuant to the bill and which
 11 35 complies with federal pole attachment requirements.
 12  1 The bill provides that a new, replacement, or modified
 12  2 utility pole or wireless support structure installed in
 12  3 the public right=of=way for the siting of a small wireless
 12  4 facility shall not exceed the greater of 10 feet in height
 12  5 above the tallest utility pole existing on or before July
 12  6 1, 2017, located within 500 feet of the new or replacement
 12  7 utility pole in the same public right=of=way, or 50 feet in
 12  8 height above ground level. However, a person may construct,
 12  9 modify, or maintain a utility pole along, across, and
 12 10 under a public right=of=way in excess of such size limits,
 12 11 subject to applicable zoning regulations and compliance with
 12 12 nondiscriminatory undergrounding requirements.
 12 13    The bill provides a series of rules and limitations
 12 14 applicable to an application for a permit. The rules and
 12 15 limitations include prohibiting requiring certain information
 12 16 from or about an applicant, limiting the amount of application
 12 17 fees for processing or issuing a permit, time frames within
 12 18 which an authority must approve or deny a permit application,
 12 19 standards for the denial of a permit application, prohibiting
 12 20 the imposition of a moratorium on the processing or issuance of
 12 21 permits, and prohibiting the processing or issuance of permits
 12 22 on a discriminatory basis, as specified in the bill.
 12 23    The bill provides that the annual recurring rate charged
 12 24 by an authority for the siting of small wireless facilities
 12 25 on utility poles cannot exceed the rate computed for
 12 26 telecommunications pole attachments pursuant to federal law.
 12 27    The bill provides that an authority must authorize the
 12 28 siting of small wireless facilities on wireless support
 12 29 structures not located within public rights=of=way to the
 12 30 same extent the authority permits access for other commercial
 12 31 projects or uses, and may authorize the siting even if the
 12 32 authority has not previously permitted access. The annual
 12 33 recurring rate for such siting cannot exceed the least of the
 12 34 amount charged for a similar project on similar property,
 12 35 the projected cost to the authority for the siting, or $100,
 13  1 adjusted every five years to reflect changes in the consumer
 13  2 price index.
 13  3    The bill provides that a party aggrieved by the final action
 13  4 or inaction of an authority may bring an action for review in
 13  5 any court of competent jurisdiction.
 13  6    The bill provides that a public utility that owns or
 13  7 controls a utility pole to which a small wireless facility
 13  8 is sited in alleged violation of the Iowa electrical safety
 13  9 code or any other applicable law must notify the owner of
 13 10 the small wireless facility of the violation, which must
 13 11 include the location of the alleged violation, a description
 13 12 of the alleged violation, and suggested corrective action.
 13 13 The owner of the small wireless facility must respond to the
 13 14 public utility within 60 days, which must include a statement
 13 15 as to whether the person is the owner of the small wireless
 13 16 facility in dispute, a statement as to whether the owner
 13 17 disputes the violation, a plan for corrective action if the
 13 18 owner does not dispute the violation, and a statement as to
 13 19 whether the violation has been corrected. The owner must take
 13 20 corrective action to correct an alleged violation within 180
 13 21 days after receiving notice of the alleged violation, unless
 13 22 good cause is shown that a delay is appropriate, as specified
 13 23 in the bill. The bill provides that either party may file
 13 24 an action concerning an alleged violation in the appropriate
 13 25 district court for injunctive relief or any other appropriate
 13 26 remedy, including the removal of a small wireless facility,
 13 27 if the parties cannot resolve the dispute after following the
 13 28 procedures provided in the bill.
 13 29    The bill amends Code section 8C.9 to repeal Code chapter 8C
 13 30 on July 1, 2022, instead of on July 1, 2020.
 13 31    Code chapter 28F provides for the joint financing by public
 13 32 agencies of certain public works and facilities. The bill
 13 33 amends Code section 28F.1 to include works or facilities
 13 34 useful for the operation of a telecommunications system or

 10 15 communications facilities and infrastructure. The bill adds
 10 16 specific rules and limitations for the application for and
 10 17 deployment of small wireless facilities.
 10 18    The bill amends the definition of "authority" in Code
 10 19 section 8C.2 to exclude municipally owned utilities established
 10 20 under Title IX, subtitle 4 of the Code that do not have zoning
 10 21 or permitting authority with respect to the siting of small
 10 22 wireless facilities. The bill defines "siting" to mean the
 10 23 mounting, installation, maintenance, modification, operation,
 10 24 or replacement of a small wireless facility on or adjacent to
 10 25 an existing utility pole or other structure, a replacement
 10 26 utility pole, or a new utility pole. The bill defines "small
 10 27 wireless facility" as a wireless facility where each antenna is
 10 28 no more than six cubic feet in volume and all other equipment,
 10 29 except for certain equipment described in the bill, is
 10 30 cumulatively no more than 28 cubic feet in volume, as measured
 10 31 by its external displacement. A "small wireless facility" does
 10 32 not include any structure that supports or houses equipment.
 10 33 The bill amends the definition of "utility pole" in Code
 10 34 section 8C.2 to include wireless service. The bill defines
 10 35 "wireless facility" to mean equipment at a fixed location
 11  1 that enables the transmission of wireless communications
 11  2 and information of any kind between user equipment and a
 11  3 communications network. The bill defines "wireless service" to
 11  4 mean any fixed or mobile service using licensed or unlicensed
 11  5 wireless spectrum and provided by a wireless facility. The
 11  6 bill defines "wireless service provider" to mean a provider of
 11  7 wireless service.
 11  8    The bill prohibits an authority from restricting the siting
 11  9 of small wireless facilities. An authority with planning
 11 10 and zoning regulations shall authorize such facilities in
 11 11 zoning districts where the facilities are located on public
 11 12 rights=of=way or authority property, or where the facilities
 11 13 are sited on certain existing structures. Facilities not sited
 11 14 on such property or sited in such a manner may be classified as
 11 15 special or conditional uses. An authority may also require a
 11 16 person to obtain a special or conditional land use permit to
 11 17 install new utility poles or wireless support structures on
 11 18 certain property.
 11 19    The bill provides that an authority may require a person

 11 17 install new utility poles or wireless support structures on
 11 18 certain property.
 11 19    The bill provides that an authority may require a person
 11 20 to obtain building, electrical, or public way use permits for
 11 21 the siting of small wireless facilities if such permit is of
 11 22 general applicability and does not deny a facility access to
 11 23 a public right=of=way. However, an authority cannot require
 11 24 a person to obtain a permit for the routine maintenance or
 11 25 replacement of a previously approved facility unless such
 11 26 permit contains the same terms and conditions provided for
 11 27 other commercial projects or uses in the public right=of=way.
 11 28    The bill prohibits an authority from requiring a person to
 11 29 enter into an individual license, franchise, or other agreement
 11 30 with the authority for the siting of small wireless facilities
 11 31 on utility poles located on public rights=of=way or authority
 11 32 property, subject to nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral
 11 33 and commercially reasonable terms and conditions provided in
 11 34 a building permit obtained pursuant to the bill and which
 11 35 complies with federal pole attachment requirements.
 12  1 The bill provides that a new, replacement, or modified
 12  2 utility pole or wireless support structure installed in
 12  3 the public right=of=way for the siting of a small wireless
 12  4 facility shall not exceed the greater of 10 feet in height
 12  5 above the tallest utility pole existing on or before July
 12  6 1, 2017, located within 500 feet of the new or replacement
 12  7 utility pole in the same public right=of=way, or 50 feet in
 12  8 height above ground level. However, a person may construct,
 12  9 modify, or maintain a utility pole along, across, and
 12 10 under a public right=of=way in excess of such size limits,
 12 11 subject to applicable zoning regulations and compliance with
 12 12 nondiscriminatory undergrounding requirements.
 12 13    The bill provides a series of rules and limitations
 12 14 applicable to an application for a permit. The rules and
 12 15 limitations include prohibiting requiring certain information
 12 16 from or about an applicant, limiting the amount of application
 12 17 fees for processing or issuing a permit, time frames within
 12 18 which an authority must approve or deny a permit application,
 12 19 standards for the denial of a permit application, prohibiting
 12 20 the imposition of a moratorium on the processing or issuance of
 12 21 permits, and prohibiting the processing or issuance of permits
 12 22 on a discriminatory basis, as specified in the bill.

 12 27    The bill provides that an authority must authorize the
 12 28 siting of small wireless facilities on wireless support
 12 29 structures not located within public rights=of=way to the
 12 30 same extent the authority permits access for other commercial
 12 31 projects or uses, and may authorize the siting even if the
 12 32 authority has not previously permitted access. The annual
 12 33 recurring rate for such siting cannot exceed the least of the
 12 34 amount charged for a similar project on similar property,
 12 35 the projected cost to the authority for the siting, or $100,
 13  1 adjusted every five years to reflect changes in the consumer
 13  2 price index.
 13  3    The bill provides that a party aggrieved by the final action
 13  4 or inaction of an authority may bring an action for review in
 13  5 any court of competent jurisdiction.
 13  6    The bill provides that a public utility that owns or
 13  7 controls a utility pole to which a small wireless facility
 13  8 is sited in alleged violation of the Iowa electrical safety
 13  9 code or any other applicable law must notify the owner of
 13 10 the small wireless facility of the violation, which must
 13 11 include the location of the alleged violation, a description
 13 12 of the alleged violation, and suggested corrective action.
 13 13 The owner of the small wireless facility must respond to the
 13 14 public utility within 60 days, which must include a statement
 13 15 as to whether the person is the owner of the small wireless
 13 16 facility in dispute, a statement as to whether the owner
 13 17 disputes the violation, a plan for corrective action if the
 13 18 owner does not dispute the violation, and a statement as to
 13 19 whether the violation has been corrected. The owner must take
 13 20 corrective action to correct an alleged violation within 180
 13 21 days after receiving notice of the alleged violation, unless
 13 22 good cause is shown that a delay is appropriate, as specified
 13 23 in the bill. The bill provides that either party may file
 13 24 an action concerning an alleged violation in the appropriate
 13 25 district court for injunctive relief or any other appropriate
 13 26 remedy, including the removal of a small wireless facility,
 13 27 if the parties cannot resolve the dispute after following the
 13 28 procedures provided in the bill.
 13 29    The bill amends Code section 8C.9 to repeal Code chapter 8C
 13 30 on July 1, 2022, instead of on July 1, 2020.
 13 31    Code chapter 28F provides for the joint financing by public
 13 32 agencies of certain public works and facilities. The bill
 13 33 amends Code section 28F.1 to include works or facilities

 10 18    The bill amends the definition of "authority" in Code
 10 19 section 8C.2 to exclude municipally owned utilities established
 10 20 under Title IX, subtitle 4 of the Code that do not have zoning
 10 21 or permitting authority with respect to the siting of small
 10 22 wireless facilities. The bill defines "siting" to mean the
 10 23 mounting, installation, maintenance, modification, operation,
 10 24 or replacement of a small wireless facility on or adjacent to
 10 25 an existing utility pole or other structure, a replacement
 10 26 utility pole, or a new utility pole. The bill defines "small
 10 27 wireless facility" as a wireless facility where each antenna is
 10 28 no more than six cubic feet in volume and all other equipment,
 10 29 except for certain equipment described in the bill, is
 10 30 cumulatively no more than 28 cubic feet in volume, as measured
 10 31 by its external displacement. A "small wireless facility" does
 10 32 not include any structure that supports or houses equipment.
 10 33 The bill amends the definition of "utility pole" in Code
 10 34 section 8C.2 to include wireless service. The bill defines
 10 35 "wireless facility" to mean equipment at a fixed location
 11  1 that enables the transmission of wireless communications
 11  2 and information of any kind between user equipment and a

 11  8    The bill prohibits an authority from restricting the siting
 11  9 of small wireless facilities. An authority with planning
 11 10 and zoning regulations shall authorize such facilities in
 11 11 zoning districts where the facilities are located on public
 11 12 rights=of=way or authority property, or where the facilities
 11 13 are sited on certain existing structures. Facilities not sited
 11 14 on such property or sited in such a manner may be classified as
 11 15 special or conditional uses. An authority may also require a
 11 16 person to obtain a special or conditional land use permit to
 11 17 install new utility poles or wireless support structures on
 11 18 certain property.
 11 19    The bill provides that an authority may require a person

 12 32 authority has not previously permitted access. The annual
 12 33 recurring rate for such siting cannot exceed the least of the
 12 34 amount charged for a similar project on similar property,
 12 35 the projected cost to the authority for the siting, or $100,
 13  1 adjusted every five years to reflect changes in the consumer
 13  2 price index.
 13  3    The bill provides that a party aggrieved by the final action
 13  4 or inaction of an authority may bring an action for review in
 13  5 any court of competent jurisdiction.

 13 19 whether the violation has been corrected. The owner must take
 13 20 corrective action to correct an alleged violation within 180
 13 21 days after receiving notice of the alleged violation, unless
 13 22 good cause is shown that a delay is appropriate, as specified
 13 23 in the bill. The bill provides that either party may file
 13 24 an action concerning an alleged violation in the appropriate
 13 25 district court for injunctive relief or any other appropriate
 13 26 remedy, including the removal of a small wireless facility,
 13 27 if the parties cannot resolve the dispute after following the
 13 28 procedures provided in the bill.

 10  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 10 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 10 11    This bill authorizes the siting of small wireless facilities
 10 12 and the joint financing of telecommunications facilities.
 10 13     Code chapter 8C provides a series of uniform rules and
 10 14 limitations for the deployment of and applications for wireless
 10 15 communications facilities and infrastructure. The bill adds
 10 16 specific rules and limitations for the application for and
 10 17 deployment of small wireless facilities.
 10 18    The bill amends the definition of "authority" in Code
 10 19 section 8C.2 to exclude municipally owned utilities established
 10 20 under Title IX, subtitle 4 of the Code that do not have zoning
 10 21 or permitting authority with respect to the siting of small
 10 22 wireless facilities. The bill defines "siting" to mean the
 10 23 mounting, installation, maintenance, modification, operation,
 10 24 or replacement of a small wireless facility on or adjacent to
 10 25 an existing utility pole or other structure, a replacement
 10 26 utility pole, or a new utility pole. The bill defines "small
 10 27 wireless facility" as a wireless facility where each antenna is
 10 28 no more than six cubic feet in volume and all other equipment,
 10 29 except for certain equipment described in the bill, is
 10 30 cumulatively no more than 28 cubic feet in volume, as measured
 10 31 by its external displacement. A "small wireless facility" does
 10 32 not include any structure that supports or houses equipment.
 10 33 The bill amends the definition of "utility pole" in Code
 10 34 section 8C.2 to include wireless service. The bill defines
 10 35 "wireless facility" to mean equipment at a fixed location
 11  1 that enables the transmission of wireless communications
 11  2 and information of any kind between user equipment and a
 11  3 communications network. The bill defines "wireless service" to
 11  4 mean any fixed or mobile service using licensed or unlicensed
 11  5 wireless spectrum and provided by a wireless facility. The
 11  6 bill defines "wireless service provider" to mean a provider of
 11  7 wireless service.
 11  8    The bill prohibits an authority from restricting the siting
 11  9 of small wireless facilities. An authority with planning
 11 10 and zoning regulations shall authorize such facilities in
 11 11 zoning districts where the facilities are located on public
 11 12 rights=of=way or authority property, or where the facilities
 11 13 are sited on certain existing structures. Facilities not sited
 11 14 on such property or sited in such a manner may be classified as
 11 15 special or conditional uses. An authority may also require a
 11 16 person to obtain a special or conditional land use permit to
 11 17 install new utility poles or wireless support structures on
 11 18 certain property.
 11 19    The bill provides that an authority may require a person
 11 20 to obtain building, electrical, or public way use permits for
 11 21 the siting of small wireless facilities if such permit is of
 11 22 general applicability and does not deny a facility access to
 11 23 a public right=of=way. However, an authority cannot require
 11 24 a person to obtain a permit for the routine maintenance or
 11 25 replacement of a previously approved facility unless such
 11 26 permit contains the same terms and conditions provided for
 11 27 other commercial projects or uses in the public right=of=way.
 11 28    The bill prohibits an authority from requiring a person to
 11 29 enter into an individual license, franchise, or other agreement

 11 32 property, subject to nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral
 11 33 and commercially reasonable terms and conditions provided in
 11 34 a building permit obtained pursuant to the bill and which
 11 35 complies with federal pole attachment requirements.
 12  1 The bill provides that a new, replacement, or modified
 12  2 utility pole or wireless support structure installed in
 12  3 the public right=of=way for the siting of a small wireless
 12  4 facility shall not exceed the greater of 10 feet in height
 12  5 above the tallest utility pole existing on or before July
 12  6 1, 2017, located within 500 feet of the new or replacement
 12  7 utility pole in the same public right=of=way, or 50 feet in
 12  8 height above ground level. However, a person may construct,
 12  9 modify, or maintain a utility pole along, across, and
 12 10 under a public right=of=way in excess of such size limits,

 13  6    The bill provides that a public utility that owns or
 13  7 controls a utility pole to which a small wireless facility
 13  8 is sited in alleged violation of the Iowa electrical safety
 13  9 code or any other applicable law must notify the owner of
 13 10 the small wireless facility of the violation, which must
 13 11 include the location of the alleged violation, a description
 13 12 of the alleged violation, and suggested corrective action.
 13 13 The owner of the small wireless facility must respond to the
 13 14 public utility within 60 days, which must include a statement
 13 15 as to whether the person is the owner of the small wireless
 13 16 facility in dispute, a statement as to whether the owner
 13 17 disputes the violation, a plan for corrective action if the

 10 20 under Title IX, subtitle 4 of the Code that do not have zoning
 10 21 or permitting authority with respect to the siting of small
 10 22 wireless facilities. The bill defines "siting" to mean the
 10 23 mounting, installation, maintenance, modification, operation,
 10 24 or replacement of a small wireless facility on or adjacent to
 10 25 an existing utility pole or other structure, a replacement
 10 26 utility pole, or a new utility pole. The bill defines "small
 10 27 wireless facility" as a wireless facility where each antenna is
 10 28 no more than six cubic feet in volume and all other equipment,
 10 29 except for certain equipment described in the bill, is
 10 30 cumulatively no more than 28 cubic feet in volume, as measured

 11  7 wireless service.
 11  8    The bill prohibits an authority from restricting the siting
 11  9 of small wireless facilities. An authority with planning
 11 10 and zoning regulations shall authorize such facilities in
 11 11 zoning districts where the facilities are located on public
 11 12 rights=of=way or authority property, or where the facilities
 11 13 are sited on certain existing structures. Facilities not sited
 11 14 on such property or sited in such a manner may be classified as
 11 15 special or conditional uses. An authority may also require a
 11 16 person to obtain a special or conditional land use permit to
 11 17 install new utility poles or wireless support structures on
 11 18 certain property.
 11 19    The bill provides that an authority may require a person
 11 20 to obtain building, electrical, or public way use permits for
 11 21 the siting of small wireless facilities if such permit is of
 11 22 general applicability and does not deny a facility access to
 11 23 a public right=of=way. However, an authority cannot require
 11 24 a person to obtain a permit for the routine maintenance or
 11 25 replacement of a previously approved facility unless such
 11 26 permit contains the same terms and conditions provided for
 11 27 other commercial projects or uses in the public right=of=way.

 11 32 property, subject to nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral
 11 33 and commercially reasonable terms and conditions provided in
 11 34 a building permit obtained pursuant to the bill and which
 11 35 complies with federal pole attachment requirements.
 12  1 The bill provides that a new, replacement, or modified
 12  2 utility pole or wireless support structure installed in
 12  3 the public right=of=way for the siting of a small wireless
 12  4 facility shall not exceed the greater of 10 feet in height
 12  5 above the tallest utility pole existing on or before July
 12  6 1, 2017, located within 500 feet of the new or replacement
 12  7 utility pole in the same public right=of=way, or 50 feet in
 12  8 height above ground level. However, a person may construct,
 12  9 modify, or maintain a utility pole along, across, and
 12 10 under a public right=of=way in excess of such size limits,
 12 11 subject to applicable zoning regulations and compliance with
 12 12 nondiscriminatory undergrounding requirements.

 12 27    The bill provides that an authority must authorize the
 12 28 siting of small wireless facilities on wireless support
 12 29 structures not located within public rights=of=way to the
 12 30 same extent the authority permits access for other commercial
 12 31 projects or uses, and may authorize the siting even if the
 12 32 authority has not previously permitted access. The annual
 12 33 recurring rate for such siting cannot exceed the least of the
 12 34 amount charged for a similar project on similar property,
 12 35 the projected cost to the authority for the siting, or $100,
 13  1 adjusted every five years to reflect changes in the consumer
 13  2 price index.

 10 25 an existing utility pole or other structure, a replacement
 10 26 utility pole, or a new utility pole. The bill defines "small
 10 27 wireless facility" as a wireless facility where each antenna is
 10 28 no more than six cubic feet in volume and all other equipment,
 10 29 except for certain equipment described in the bill, is
 10 30 cumulatively no more than 28 cubic feet in volume, as measured
 10 31 by its external displacement. A "small wireless facility" does
 10 32 not include any structure that supports or houses equipment.
 10 33 The bill amends the definition of "utility pole" in Code
 10 34 section 8C.2 to include wireless service. The bill defines
 10 35 "wireless facility" to mean equipment at a fixed location
 11  1 that enables the transmission of wireless communications
 11  2 and information of any kind between user equipment and a
 11  3 communications network. The bill defines "wireless service" to
 11  4 mean any fixed or mobile service using licensed or unlicensed
 11  5 wireless spectrum and provided by a wireless facility. The
 11  6 bill defines "wireless service provider" to mean a provider of
 11  7 wireless service.
 11  8    The bill prohibits an authority from restricting the siting
 11  9 of small wireless facilities. An authority with planning
 11 10 and zoning regulations shall authorize such facilities in
 11 11 zoning districts where the facilities are located on public
 11 12 rights=of=way or authority property, or where the facilities
 11 13 are sited on certain existing structures. Facilities not sited
 11 14 on such property or sited in such a manner may be classified as
 11 15 special or conditional uses. An authority may also require a
 11 16 person to obtain a special or conditional land use permit to
 11 17 install new utility poles or wireless support structures on
 11 18 certain property.
 11 19    The bill provides that an authority may require a person
 11 20 to obtain building, electrical, or public way use permits for
 11 21 the siting of small wireless facilities if such permit is of
 11 22 general applicability and does not deny a facility access to
 11 23 a public right=of=way. However, an authority cannot require
 11 24 a person to obtain a permit for the routine maintenance or
 11 25 replacement of a previously approved facility unless such
 11 26 permit contains the same terms and conditions provided for
 11 27 other commercial projects or uses in the public right=of=way.
 11 28    The bill prohibits an authority from requiring a person to
 11 29 enter into an individual license, franchise, or other agreement
 11 30 with the authority for the siting of small wireless facilities
 11 31 on utility poles located on public rights=of=way or authority
 11 32 property, subject to nondiscriminatory, competitively neutral
 11 33 and commercially reasonable terms and conditions provided in
 11 34 a building permit obtained pursuant to the bill and which
 11 35 complies with federal pole attachment requirements.
 12  1 The bill provides that a new, replacement, or modified
 12  2 utility pole or wireless support structure installed in
 12  3 the public right=of=way for the siting of a small wireless
 12  4 facility shall not exceed the greater of 10 feet in height
 12  5 above the tallest utility pole existing on or before July
 12  6 1, 2017, located within 500 feet of the new or replacement
 12  7 utility pole in the same public right=of=way, or 50 feet in
 12  8 height above ground level. However, a person may construct,
 12  9 modify, or maintain a utility pole along, across, and
 12 10 under a public right=of=way in excess of such size limits,
 12 11 subject to applicable zoning regulations and compliance with
 12 12 nondiscriminatory undergrounding requirements.
 12 13    The bill provides a series of rules and limitations
 12 14 applicable to an application for a permit. The rules and
 12 15 limitations include prohibiting requiring certain information
 12 16 from or about an applicant, limiting the amount of application
 12 17 fees for processing or issuing a permit, time frames within
 12 18 which an authority must approve or deny a permit application,
 12 19 standards for the denial of a permit application, prohibiting
 12 20 the imposition of a moratorium on the processing or issuance of
 12 21 permits, and prohibiting the processing or issuance of permits
 12 22 on a discriminatory basis, as specified in the bill.
 12 23    The bill provides that the annual recurring rate charged
 12 24 by an authority for the siting of small wireless facilities
 12 25 on utility poles cannot exceed the rate computed for
 12 26 telecommunications pole attachments pursuant to federal law.
 12 27    The bill provides that an authority must authorize the
 12 28 siting of small wireless facilities on wireless support
 12 29 structures not located within public rights=of=way to the
 12 30 same extent the authority permits access for other commercial
 12 31 projects or uses, and may authorize the siting even if the
 12 32 authority has not previously permitted access. The annual
 12 33 recurring rate for such siting cannot exceed the least of the
 12 34 amount charged for a similar project on similar property,
 12 35 the projected cost to the authority for the siting, or $100,
 13  1 adjusted every five years to reflect changes in the consumer
 13  2 price index.
 13  3    The bill provides that a party aggrieved by the final action
 13  4 or inaction of an authority may bring an action for review in
 13  5 any court of competent jurisdiction.
 13  6    The bill provides that a public utility that owns or
 13  7 controls a utility pole to which a small wireless facility
 13  8 is sited in alleged violation of the Iowa electrical safety
 13  9 code or any other applicable law must notify the owner of
 13 10 the small wireless facility of the violation, which must
 13 11 include the location of the alleged violation, a description
 13 12 of the alleged violation, and suggested corrective action.
 13 13 The owner of the small wireless facility must respond to the
 13 14 public utility within 60 days, which must include a statement
 13 15 as to whether the person is the owner of the small wireless
 13 16 facility in dispute, a statement as to whether the owner
 13 17 disputes the violation, a plan for corrective action if the
 13 18 owner does not dispute the violation, and a statement as to
 13 19 whether the violation has been corrected. The owner must take
 13 20 corrective action to correct an alleged violation within 180
 13 21 days after receiving notice of the alleged violation, unless
 13 22 good cause is shown that a delay is appropriate, as specified
 13 23 in the bill. The bill provides that either party may file
 13 24 an action concerning an alleged violation in the appropriate
 13 25 district court for injunctive relief or any other appropriate
 13 26 remedy, including the removal of a small wireless facility,
 13 27 if the parties cannot resolve the dispute after following the
 13 28 procedures provided in the bill.
 13 29    The bill amends Code section 8C.9 to repeal Code chapter 8C
 13 30 on July 1, 2022, instead of on July 1, 2020.
 13 31    Code chapter 28F provides for the joint financing by public
 13 32 agencies of certain public works and facilities. The bill
 13 33 amends Code section 28F.1 to include works or facilities
 13 34 useful for the operation of a telecommunications system or
 13 35 the provision of telecommunications services in the list of
 14  1 specified facilities subject to joint financing by public
 14  2 agencies.

 11 12 rights=of=way or authority property, or where the facilities
 11 13 are sited on certain existing structures. Facilities not sited
 11 14 on such property or sited in such a manner may be classified as
 11 15 special or conditional uses. An authority may also require a
 11 16 person to obtain a special or conditional land use permit to
 11 17 install new utility poles or wireless support structures on
 11 18 certain property.
 11 19    The bill provides that an authority may require a person
 11 20 to obtain building, electrical, or public way use permits for
 11 21 the siting of small wireless facilities if such permit is of
 11 22 general applicability and does not deny a facility access to
 11 23 a public right=of=way. However, an authority cannot require
 11 24 a person to obtain a permit for the routine maintenance or
 11 25 replacement of a previously approved facility unless such
 11 26 permit contains the same terms and conditions provided for
 11 27 other commercial projects or uses in the public right=of=way.
 11 28    The bill prohibits an authority from requiring a person to
 11 29 enter into an individual license, franchise, or other agreement
 11 30 with the authority for the siting of small wireless facilities

 12  5 above the tallest utility pole existing on or before July
 12  6 1, 2017, located within 500 feet of the new or replacement
 12  7 utility pole in the same public right=of=way, or 50 feet in
 12  8 height above ground level. However, a person may construct,
 12  9 modify, or maintain a utility pole along, across, and
 12 10 under a public right=of=way in excess of such size limits,
 12 11 subject to applicable zoning regulations and compliance with

 12 24 by an authority for the siting of small wireless facilities
 12 25 on utility poles cannot exceed the rate computed for
 12 26 telecommunications pole attachments pursuant to federal law.
 12 27    The bill provides that an authority must authorize the
 12 28 siting of small wireless facilities on wireless support
 12 29 structures not located within public rights=of=way to the
 12 30 same extent the authority permits access for other commercial
 12 31 projects or uses, and may authorize the siting even if the
 12 32 authority has not previously permitted access. The annual
 12 33 recurring rate for such siting cannot exceed the least of the
 12 34 amount charged for a similar project on similar property,
 12 35 the projected cost to the authority for the siting, or $100,
 13  1 adjusted every five years to reflect changes in the consumer
 13  2 price index.
 13  3    The bill provides that a party aggrieved by the final action
 13  4 or inaction of an authority may bring an action for review in
 13  5 any court of competent jurisdiction.

 13 19 whether the violation has been corrected. The owner must take
 13 20 corrective action to correct an alleged violation within 180
 13 21 days after receiving notice of the alleged violation, unless
 13 22 good cause is shown that a delay is appropriate, as specified
 13 23 in the bill. The bill provides that either party may file
 13 24 an action concerning an alleged violation in the appropriate
 13 25 district court for injunctive relief or any other appropriate
 13 26 remedy, including the removal of a small wireless facility,
 13 27 if the parties cannot resolve the dispute after following the
