 25 19 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 25 20    CURRENT LAW.  Code chapter 162 provides for the regulation
 25 21 of commercial establishments that possess or control animals,
 25 22 other than animals used for an agricultural purpose (Code
 25 23 section 162.1), by the department of agriculture and land
 25 24 stewardship (DALS).  Commercial establishments include animal
 25 25 shelters, pounds, and research facilities which are required
 25 26 to obtain a certificate of registration; boarding kennels,
 25 27 commercial kennels, and pet shops which are required to
 25 28 obtain a state license; and commercial breeders, dealers, and
 25 29 public auctions which are required to obtain a state license
 25 30 or a permit if licensed by the United States department of
 25 31 agriculture (USDA) (Code section 162.2A).
 25 32    BILL'S PROVISIONS.  This bill refers to each type of
 25 33 commercial establishment as a class and requires that a person
 25 34 operating one or more commercial establishments of the same
 25 35 class obtain a single license. The bill also creates four new
 26  1 types of licenses for: (1) grooming facilities, (2) animal
 26  2 rescues, (3) animal sanctuaries, and (4) small breeders,
 26  3 competitive show breeders, or specialized breeders. The bill
 26  4 also recognizes animal foster care homes that temporarily
 26  5 maintain dogs or cats on behalf of animal rescues, animal
 26  6 shelters, and pounds. The bill replaces the current fee system
 26  7 with one that includes the assessment of a base amount and
 26  8 the possible assessment of a scheduled amount based on class.
 26  9 The moneys from fees are still deposited into the commercial
 26 10 establishment fund. However, an amount is to be transferred
 26 11 to a new animal rescue remediation fund also under the control
 26 12 of DALS.  The bill requires DALS to perform inspections and
 26 13 licensees to maintain records. The bill provides that DALS may
 26 14 take disciplinary action by suspending or revoking the person's
 26 15 license. It provides that any continuing education program
 26 16 voluntarily completed by a person operating a commercial
 26 17 establishment prior to a disciplinary action is not considered
 26 18 part of such action. The bill provides for the sterilization
 26 19 of dogs or cats that are in the custody of an animal sanctuary.
 26 20 Greyhound dogs used in pari=mutuel wagering are exempted from
 26 21 regulation. Finally, the bill provides that the attorney
 26 22 general or a county attorney may bring a criminal action in
 26 23 order to enforce the provisions of the Code chapter and allows
 26 24 a court to provide injunctive relief.
