 11 29 superintendent, or principal authorized by the superintendent,
 11 30 the DOT may issue a class C or M driver's license to a person
 11 31 between the ages of 14 and 18 years old. The bill allows
 11 32 the authorities in charge of a person's accredited nonpublic
 11 33 school, or a duly authorized representative of the authorities,
 11 34 to provide the certification of special need.
 11 35    The bill authorizes a person who holds such a license and
 12  1 attends an accredited nonpublic school to operate a motor
 12  2 vehicle during the hours of 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. over

 12 26 a need exists for a license. The student may appeal to the
 12 27 school board the decision of a school district administrator to
 12 28 deny certification. The decision of the school board is final.

 13  2 in charge of the accredited nonpublic school is final.

 13  4 for purposes of attending an accredited nonpublic school if the
 13  5 driving distance between the school and the residence of the
 13  6 parent or guardian of the student is more than 25 miles.
