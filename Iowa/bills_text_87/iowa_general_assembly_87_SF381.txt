  8 29                           EXPLANATION
  8 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 32    This bill provides for the registration of eligible electors
  8 33 upon review of electronic records received from state agencies.
  8 34    The bill allows for registration of eligible electors
  8 35 to vote following review of electronic records received
  9  1 from driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
  9  2 applications by county commissioners of registration (county
  9  3 auditors).
  9  4    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9  5 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9  6 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9  7 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9  8 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9  9 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 10 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 11 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  9 12 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  9 13 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  9 14 social security number, and other information. Under current
  9 15 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  9 16 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  9 17 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  9 18 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  9 19 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  9 20 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  9 21 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  9 22 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  9 23 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  9 24 state department of transportation.
  9 25    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  9 26 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  9 27 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  9 28 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  9 29 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  9 30 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  9 31 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  9 32 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  9 33 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  9 34 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  9 35 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10  1 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10  2 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10  3 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10  4 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10  5 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10  6 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10  7 required by current law.
 10  8    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10  9 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 10 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 11 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 10 12 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 10 13 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 10 14 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 10 15 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 10 16 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 10 17 person submitting an application for a license or card will not
 10 18 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code
 10 19 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 10 20    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 10 21 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 10 22 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 10 23 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 10 24 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 10 25 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 10 26 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 10 27 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 10 28 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 10 29 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 10 30 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 10 31 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 10 32    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 10 33 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 10 34 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 10 35 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11  1 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11  2 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11  3 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11  4 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11  5 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11  6 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11  7 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11  8 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11  9 registrar of voters.
 11 10    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 11 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 11 12 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 11 13 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 11 14 to be established by the state commission.
 11 15    The bill also allows for automatic voter registration
 11 16 to be completed based upon information received from voter
 11 17 registration agencies, including, under the bill, the
 11 18 department of education, the board of regents and each
 11 19 institution governed by the board of regents, and other state
 11 20 agencies that collect personal information sufficient to
 11 21 complete a voter registration application.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 11 23 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 11 24 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 11 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 11 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 11 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 11 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 11 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 11 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 11 32 mandate included in the bill.
 11 33    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  8 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 32    This bill provides for the registration of eligible electors
  8 33 upon review of electronic records received from state agencies.
  8 34    The bill allows for registration of eligible electors
  8 35 to vote following review of electronic records received
  9  1 from driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
  9  2 applications by county commissioners of registration (county
  9  3 auditors).
  9  4    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9  5 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9  6 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9  7 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9  8 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9  9 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 10 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 11 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  9 12 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  9 13 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  9 14 social security number, and other information. Under current
  9 15 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  9 16 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  9 17 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  9 18 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  9 19 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  9 20 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  9 21 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  9 22 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  9 23 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  9 24 state department of transportation.
  9 25    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  9 26 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  9 27 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  9 28 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  9 29 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  9 30 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  9 31 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  9 32 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  9 33 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  9 34 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  9 35 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10  1 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10  2 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10  3 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10  4 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10  5 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10  6 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10  7 required by current law.
 10  8    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10  9 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 10 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 11 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 10 12 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 10 13 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 10 14 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 10 15 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 10 16 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 10 17 person submitting an application for a license or card will not
 10 18 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code
 10 19 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 10 20    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 10 21 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 10 22 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 10 23 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 10 24 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by

 10 26 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 10 27 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 10 28 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 10 29 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 10 30 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 10 31 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 10 32    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 10 33 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter

 11  6 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms

 11 12 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter

 10  5 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to

 10  8    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10  9 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 10 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 11 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an

 10 14 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 10 15 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute

  8 29                           EXPLANATION
  8 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 32    This bill provides for the registration of eligible electors
  8 33 upon review of electronic records received from state agencies.
  8 34    The bill allows for registration of eligible electors
  8 35 to vote following review of electronic records received
  9  1 from driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
  9  2 applications by county commissioners of registration (county
  9  3 auditors).
  9  4    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9  5 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9  6 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9  7 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9  8 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9  9 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 10 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 11 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  9 12 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  9 13 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  9 14 social security number, and other information. Under current
  9 15 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  9 16 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  9 17 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  9 18 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  9 19 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  9 20 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  9 21 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  9 22 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  9 23 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  9 24 state department of transportation.
  9 25    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  9 26 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  9 27 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  9 28 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  9 29 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  9 30 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  9 31 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  9 32 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  9 33 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  9 34 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  9 35 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10  1 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10  2 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10  3 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10  4 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10  5 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10  6 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10  7 required by current law.
 10  8    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10  9 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 10 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 11 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 10 12 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 10 13 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 10 14 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 10 15 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 10 16 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 10 17 person submitting an application for a license or card will not
 10 18 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code
 10 19 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 10 20    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 10 21 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 10 22 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 10 23 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 10 24 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 10 25 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 10 26 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 10 27 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 10 28 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 10 29 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 10 30 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 10 31 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 10 32    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 10 33 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 10 34 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 10 35 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11  1 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11  2 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11  3 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11  4 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11  5 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11  6 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11  7 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11  8 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11  9 registrar of voters.
 11 10    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 11 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 11 12 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 11 13 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 11 14 to be established by the state commission.
 11 15    The bill also allows for automatic voter registration
 11 16 to be completed based upon information received from voter
 11 17 registration agencies, including, under the bill, the
 11 18 department of education, the board of regents and each
 11 19 institution governed by the board of regents, and other state
 11 20 agencies that collect personal information sufficient to
 11 21 complete a voter registration application.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 11 23 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 11 24 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 11 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 11 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 11 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 11 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 11 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 11 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 11 32 mandate included in the bill.
 11 33    The bill takes effect upon enactment.

  8 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 32    This bill provides for the registration of eligible electors
  8 33 upon review of electronic records received from state agencies.
  8 34    The bill allows for registration of eligible electors
  8 35 to vote following review of electronic records received
  9  1 from driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
  9  2 applications by county commissioners of registration (county
  9  3 auditors).
  9  4    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9  5 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9  6 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9  7 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9  8 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9  9 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 10 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 11 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  9 12 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  9 13 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  9 14 social security number, and other information. Under current
  9 15 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  9 16 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  9 17 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  9 18 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  9 19 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  9 20 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  9 21 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  9 22 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  9 23 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  9 24 state department of transportation.
  9 25    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  9 26 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  9 27 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  9 28 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  9 29 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  9 30 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  9 31 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  9 32 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  9 33 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  9 34 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  9 35 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10  1 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10  2 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10  3 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10  4 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10  5 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10  6 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10  7 required by current law.
 10  8    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10  9 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 10 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 11 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 10 12 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 10 13 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 10 14 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 10 15 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 10 16 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 10 17 person submitting an application for a license or card will not
 10 18 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code
 10 19 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 10 20    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 10 21 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 10 22 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 10 23 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 10 24 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by

 10 26 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 10 27 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 10 28 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 10 29 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 10 30 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 10 31 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 10 32    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 10 33 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 10 34 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 10 35 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11  1 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper

 11  3 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11  4 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to

 11  6 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11  7 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11  8 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11  9 registrar of voters.
 11 10    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 11 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 11 12 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 11 13 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 11 14 to be established by the state commission.
 11 15    The bill also allows for automatic voter registration

  9  2 applications by county commissioners of registration (county

  9 12 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current

  9 25    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit

  9 27 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  9 28 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review

  9 30 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  9 31 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  9 32 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  9 33 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the

 10  2 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10  3 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10  4 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10  5 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10  6 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10  7 required by current law.
 10  8    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10  9 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 10 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 11 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 10 12 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 10 13 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 10 14 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 10 15 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 10 16 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 10 17 person submitting an application for a license or card will not
 10 18 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code

 10 29 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 10 30 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 10 31 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 10 32    The bill makes changes to current law related to address

  8 32    This bill provides for the registration of eligible electors
  8 33 upon review of electronic records received from state agencies.
  8 34    The bill allows for registration of eligible electors
  8 35 to vote following review of electronic records received
  9  1 from driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
  9  2 applications by county commissioners of registration (county
  9  3 auditors).
  9  4    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9  5 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9  6 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9  7 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9  8 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9  9 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 10 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 11 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  9 12 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  9 13 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  9 14 social security number, and other information. Under current
  9 15 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  9 16 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  9 17 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  9 18 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  9 19 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  9 20 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  9 21 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  9 22 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  9 23 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  9 24 state department of transportation.
  9 25    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  9 26 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  9 27 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  9 28 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  9 29 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  9 30 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  9 31 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  9 32 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  9 33 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  9 34 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  9 35 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10  1 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10  2 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10  3 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10  4 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10  5 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10  6 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10  7 required by current law.
 10  8    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10  9 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 10 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 11 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 10 12 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 10 13 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 10 14 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 10 15 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute

 10 17 person submitting an application for a license or card will not
 10 18 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code
 10 19 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 10 20    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 10 21 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 10 22 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 10 23 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 10 24 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 10 25 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 10 26 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 10 27 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 10 28 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 10 29 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 10 30 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 10 31 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 10 32    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 10 33 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 10 34 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 10 35 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11  1 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11  2 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11  3 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11  4 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11  5 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11  6 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11  7 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11  8 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11  9 registrar of voters.
 11 10    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 11 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 11 12 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 11 13 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 11 14 to be established by the state commission.
 11 15    The bill also allows for automatic voter registration
 11 16 to be completed based upon information received from voter
 11 17 registration agencies, including, under the bill, the
 11 18 department of education, the board of regents and each
 11 19 institution governed by the board of regents, and other state
 11 20 agencies that collect personal information sufficient to
 11 21 complete a voter registration application.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 11 23 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 11 24 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 11 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 11 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 11 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 11 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 11 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 11 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 11 32 mandate included in the bill.

  8 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 32    This bill provides for the registration of eligible electors
  8 33 upon review of electronic records received from state agencies.
  8 34    The bill allows for registration of eligible electors
  8 35 to vote following review of electronic records received
  9  1 from driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
  9  2 applications by county commissioners of registration (county
  9  3 auditors).
  9  4    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9  5 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9  6 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9  7 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9  8 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9  9 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 10 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 11 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  9 12 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  9 13 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  9 14 social security number, and other information. Under current
  9 15 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  9 16 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  9 17 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  9 18 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  9 19 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  9 20 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  9 21 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  9 22 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  9 23 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  9 24 state department of transportation.
  9 25    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  9 26 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  9 27 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  9 28 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  9 29 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  9 30 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  9 31 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  9 32 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  9 33 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  9 34 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  9 35 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10  1 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10  2 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10  3 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10  4 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10  5 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10  6 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10  7 required by current law.
 10  8    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10  9 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 10 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 11 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 10 12 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 10 13 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 10 14 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 10 15 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 10 16 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 10 17 person submitting an application for a license or card will not
 10 18 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code
 10 19 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 10 20    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 10 21 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 10 22 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 10 23 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 10 24 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 10 25 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 10 26 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 10 27 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 10 28 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 10 29 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 10 30 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 10 31 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).

 10 33 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter

  9 16 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  9 17 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  9 18 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  9 19 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  9 20 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  9 21 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  9 22 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  9 23 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  9 24 state department of transportation.
  9 25    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  9 26 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  9 27 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  9 28 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  9 29 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  9 30 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  9 31 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  9 32 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  9 33 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  9 34 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  9 35 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10  1 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10  2 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10  3 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10  4 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10  5 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10  6 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10  7 required by current law.
 10  8    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10  9 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 10 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 11 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 10 12 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 10 13 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 10 14 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 10 15 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 10 16 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 10 17 person submitting an application for a license or card will not
 10 18 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code
 10 19 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 10 20    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 10 21 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 10 22 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 10 23 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 10 24 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 10 25 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 10 26 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 10 27 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 10 28 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 10 29 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 10 30 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 10 31 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 10 32    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 10 33 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 10 34 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 10 35 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11  1 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11  2 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11  3 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11  4 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11  5 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11  6 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11  7 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11  8 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11  9 registrar of voters.
 11 10    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 11 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 11 12 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 11 13 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 11 14 to be established by the state commission.
 11 15    The bill also allows for automatic voter registration
 11 16 to be completed based upon information received from voter
 11 17 registration agencies, including, under the bill, the
 11 18 department of education, the board of regents and each
 11 19 institution governed by the board of regents, and other state
 11 20 agencies that collect personal information sufficient to
 11 21 complete a voter registration application.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 11 23 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 11 24 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 11 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 11 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 11 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 11 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 11 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 11 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 11 32 mandate included in the bill.

  8 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  8 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  8 32    This bill provides for the registration of eligible electors
  8 33 upon review of electronic records received from state agencies.
  8 34    The bill allows for registration of eligible electors
  8 35 to vote following review of electronic records received
  9  1 from driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
  9  2 applications by county commissioners of registration (county
  9  3 auditors).
  9  4    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9  5 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9  6 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9  7 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9  8 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9  9 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 10 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 11 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  9 12 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  9 13 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  9 14 social security number, and other information. Under current
  9 15 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  9 16 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  9 17 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  9 18 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  9 19 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  9 20 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,

  9 22 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  9 23 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the

  9 25    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  9 26 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  9 27 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  9 28 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  9 29 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  9 30 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  9 31 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  9 32 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  9 33 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  9 34 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  9 35 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10  1 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10  2 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10  3 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10  4 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10  5 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10  6 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10  7 required by current law.
 10  8    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10  9 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 10 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 11 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 10 12 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 10 13 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 10 14 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 10 15 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 10 16 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 10 17 person submitting an application for a license or card will not
 10 18 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code
 10 19 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 10 20    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 10 21 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 10 22 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 10 23 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking

 10 29 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 10 30 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 10 31 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).

  8 34    The bill allows for registration of eligible electors
  8 35 to vote following review of electronic records received
  9  1 from driver's license and nonoperator's identification card
  9  2 applications by county commissioners of registration (county
  9  3 auditors).
  9  4    The bill requires that the office of driver services of the
  9  5 department of transportation transmit to the state registrar of
  9  6 voters (the secretary of state) electronic records containing
  9  7 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9  8 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9  9 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 10 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 11 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  9 12 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  9 13 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  9 14 social security number, and other information. Under current
  9 15 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  9 16 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  9 17 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  9 18 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  9 19 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  9 20 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  9 21 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  9 22 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  9 23 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  9 24 state department of transportation.
  9 25    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  9 26 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  9 27 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  9 28 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  9 29 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  9 30 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  9 31 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  9 32 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  9 33 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  9 34 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  9 35 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10  1 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10  2 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10  3 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10  4 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10  5 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10  6 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10  7 required by current law.
 10  8    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10  9 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 10 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 11 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 10 12 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 10 13 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 10 14 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 10 15 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 10 16 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 10 17 person submitting an application for a license or card will not
 10 18 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code
 10 19 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 10 20    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 10 21 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 10 22 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 10 23 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 10 24 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 10 25 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 10 26 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 10 27 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 10 28 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 10 29 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 10 30 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 10 31 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 10 32    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 10 33 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 10 34 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 10 35 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11  1 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11  2 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11  3 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11  4 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11  5 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11  6 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11  7 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11  8 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11  9 registrar of voters.
 11 10    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 11 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 11 12 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 11 13 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 11 14 to be established by the state commission.
 11 15    The bill also allows for automatic voter registration
 11 16 to be completed based upon information received from voter
 11 17 registration agencies, including, under the bill, the
 11 18 department of education, the board of regents and each
 11 19 institution governed by the board of regents, and other state
 11 20 agencies that collect personal information sufficient to
 11 21 complete a voter registration application.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 11 23 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 11 24 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 11 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 11 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 11 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 11 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 11 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 11 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state

  9  7 the legal name, age, residence, and citizenship information
  9  8 for, and the electronic signature of, each person submitting
  9  9 an application for a driver's license or nonoperator's
  9 10 identification card, or any renewal application. Current Code
  9 11 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  9 12 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  9 13 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  9 14 social security number, and other information. Under current
  9 15 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  9 16 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  9 17 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  9 18 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  9 19 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  9 20 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  9 21 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  9 22 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  9 23 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  9 24 state department of transportation.
  9 25    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  9 26 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  9 27 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  9 28 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  9 29 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  9 30 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  9 31 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  9 32 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  9 33 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  9 34 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  9 35 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10  1 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10  2 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10  3 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10  4 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10  5 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10  6 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10  7 required by current law.
 10  8    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10  9 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 10 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 11 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 10 12 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 10 13 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 10 14 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 10 15 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 10 16 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 10 17 person submitting an application for a license or card will not
 10 18 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code
 10 19 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.

 10 21 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 10 22 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 10 23 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 10 24 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 10 25 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 10 26 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 10 27 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 10 28 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 10 29 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 10 30 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 10 31 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).

 11  1 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11  2 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11  3 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11  4 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11  5 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11  6 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11  7 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11  8 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11  9 registrar of voters.
 11 10    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 11 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter

 11 15    The bill also allows for automatic voter registration
 11 16 to be completed based upon information received from voter
 11 17 registration agencies, including, under the bill, the
 11 18 department of education, the board of regents and each
 11 19 institution governed by the board of regents, and other state
 11 20 agencies that collect personal information sufficient to
 11 21 complete a voter registration application.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 11 23 commission, in cooperation with the department of

  9 21 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  9 22 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  9 23 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  9 24 state department of transportation.
  9 25    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  9 26 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  9 27 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  9 28 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  9 29 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  9 30 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  9 31 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  9 32 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  9 33 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  9 34 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  9 35 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10  1 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10  2 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10  3 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10  4 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10  5 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10  6 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10  7 required by current law.
 10  8    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10  9 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 10 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 11 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 10 12 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 10 13 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 10 14 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 10 15 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 10 16 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 10 17 person submitting an application for a license or card will not
 10 18 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code
 10 19 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.

 10 23 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 10 24 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 10 25 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 10 26 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 10 27 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 10 28 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 10 29 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 10 30 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an

 11  1 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11  2 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11  3 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11  4 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11  5 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11  6 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11  7 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11  8 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11  9 registrar of voters.
 11 10    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 11 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 11 12 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 11 13 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 11 14 to be established by the state commission.
 11 15    The bill also allows for automatic voter registration
 11 16 to be completed based upon information received from voter
 11 17 registration agencies, including, under the bill, the
 11 18 department of education, the board of regents and each
 11 19 institution governed by the board of regents, and other state
 11 20 agencies that collect personal information sufficient to
 11 21 complete a voter registration application.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 11 23 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 11 24 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 11 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 11 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 11 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 11 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 11 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,

 10 35 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11  1 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11  2 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11  3 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11  4 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11  5 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11  6 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11  7 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11  8 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11  9 registrar of voters.
 11 10    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 11 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 11 12 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 11 13 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 11 14 to be established by the state commission.
 11 15    The bill also allows for automatic voter registration
 11 16 to be completed based upon information received from voter
 11 17 registration agencies, including, under the bill, the
 11 18 department of education, the board of regents and each
 11 19 institution governed by the board of regents, and other state
 11 20 agencies that collect personal information sufficient to
 11 21 complete a voter registration application.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 11 23 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 11 24 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 11 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 11 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 11 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 11 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 11 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 11 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state

  9 31 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  9 32 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  9 33 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  9 34 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare

 10  2 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10  3 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10  4 a completed voter registration form for that person and the

  9 11 section 321.182 requires that an application for a license
  9 12 or card include an applicant's full name, signature, current
  9 13 mailing address, current residential address, date of birth,
  9 14 social security number, and other information. Under current
  9 15 administrative rules of the state department of transportation,
  9 16 an applicant for a license or card is required to provide proof
  9 17 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  9 18 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  9 19 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  9 20 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  9 21 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  9 22 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  9 23 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  9 24 state department of transportation.
  9 25    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  9 26 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  9 27 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  9 28 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  9 29 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  9 30 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  9 31 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  9 32 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  9 33 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  9 34 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  9 35 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10  1 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10  2 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10  3 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10  4 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10  5 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10  6 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10  7 required by current law.
 10  8    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10  9 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21
 10 10 days after the commissioner has issued notification to the
 10 11 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 10 12 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 10 13 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 10 14 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 10 15 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 10 16 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a
 10 17 person submitting an application for a license or card will not
 10 18 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code
 10 19 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.
 10 20    The bill also grants the state voter registration commission
 10 21 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the
 10 22 provisions of the bill relating to voter registration at motor
 10 23 vehicle driver's license stations.  If interpretive rulemaking
 10 24 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 10 25 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 10 26 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 10 27 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 10 28 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not
 10 29 clearly vested in the discretion of an agency, the applicable
 10 30 judicial standard of review is whether the rules constitute an
 10 31 erroneous interpretation of law (Code section 17A.19(10)(c)).
 10 32    The bill makes changes to current law related to address
 10 33 confidentiality program participants under Code chapter
 10 34 9E by requiring the state registrar to adopt rules for
 10 35 administration of registration for those participants. The
 11  1 bill maintains current law to allow for submission of a paper
 11  2 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11  3 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11  4 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11  5 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
 11  6 offices are required to transmit voter registration forms
 11  7 to the appropriate county commissioner and to transmit all
 11  8 electronic records and electronic signatures to the state
 11  9 registrar of voters.
 11 10    Under current law, the state registrar of voters is
 11 11 required to establish rules regulating transmission of voter
 11 12 registration forms from driver's license stations and voter
 11 13 registration agencies. Under the bill, such rules are required
 11 14 to be established by the state commission.
 11 15    The bill also allows for automatic voter registration
 11 16 to be completed based upon information received from voter
 11 17 registration agencies, including, under the bill, the
 11 18 department of education, the board of regents and each
 11 19 institution governed by the board of regents, and other state
 11 20 agencies that collect personal information sufficient to
 11 21 complete a voter registration application.
 11 22    The bill provides that the state voter registration
 11 23 commission, in cooperation with the department of
 11 24 transportation and voter registration agencies, may adopt
 11 25 emergency rules to implement the provisions of the bill.
 11 26    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 11 27 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 11 28 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 11 29 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 11 30 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 11 31 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 11 32 mandate included in the bill.

  9 17 of lawful status in the United States. Also under current
  9 18 administrative rules, a person's signature for a driver's
  9 19 license or nonoperator's identification card application is
  9 20 required to be captured electronically. Under current law,
  9 21 a county treasurer's office participating in county issuance
  9 22 of driver's licenses is required to participate in voter
  9 23 registration to the same extent as a license facility of the
  9 24 state department of transportation.
  9 25    The bill requires the state registrar of voters to transmit
  9 26 the electronic records and electronic signatures to the county
  9 27 commissioner of registration of the county where the person
  9 28 resides. The bill requires that the county commissioner review
  9 29 the electronic record and any other relevant information to
  9 30 determine if a person is an eligible elector. If the county
  9 31 commissioner determines a person to be an eligible elector
  9 32 and the person is not registered to vote in the county, the
  9 33 county commissioner is required to notify the person of the
  9 34 separate processes to decline to register to vote or to declare
  9 35 a political party affiliation. If a notified person fails to
 10  1 decline voter registration within 21 days after the county
 10  2 commissioner issued the notification, the bill provides that
 10  3 the electronic record and electronic signature shall constitute
 10  4 a completed voter registration form for that person and the
 10  5 bill requires the county commissioner to register the person to
 10  6 vote in that county and send the person an acknowledgment as
 10  7 required by current law.
 10  8    The bill prohibits a county commissioner from adding a
 10  9 person's name to a voter registration list until at least 21

 10 11 person. The bill requires that a county commissioner send an
 10 12 acknowledgment of registration within seven business days of
 10 13 registering a person under the bill. The bill also provides
 10 14 that the electronic record and electronic signature of a person
 10 15 who does not qualify as an eligible elector does not constitute
 10 16 a completed voter registration form. Under the bill, such a

 10 18 be subject to charges for voter registration fraud under Code
 10 19 section 39A.2 for submitting such an application.

 10 21 the authority to adopt rules to administer and interpret the

 10 24 authority is clearly vested in the discretion of an agency by
 10 25 statute, the applicable judicial standard of review is whether
 10 26 the rules constitute an irrational, illogical, or wholly
 10 27 unjustifiable interpretation of law by the agency (Code section
 10 28 17A.19(10)(l)). If interpretive rulemaking authority is not

 11  2 voter registration form through driver's license offices. The
 11  3 bill specifies that a requirement that separate registration
 11  4 forms be signed by each individual registrant only applies to
 11  5 paper registration forms. Under the bill, driver's license
