  4  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  4  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  4  8    Under current law, Code section 321.276 prohibits the
  4  9 use of hand=held electronic communication devices to write,
  4 10 send, or read text messages while driving a motor vehicle.
  4 11 This bill expands that provision to prohibit any use of an
  4 12 electronic communication device while driving. An electronic
  4 13 communication device is a device capable of being used to
  4 14 compose, send, receive, or read an electronic message, and
  4 15 includes telephones, personal digital assistants, and portable
  4 16 or mobile computers, but does not include devices physically
  4 17 or electronically integrated into a vehicle. An electronic
  4 18 message is a self=contained piece of digital communication,
  4 19 whether verbal or written, that is designed or intended to
  4 20 be transmitted between electronic communication devices, and
  4 21 includes telephone calls, video calls, electronic mail, text
  4 22 messages, instant messages, and commands or requests to access
  4 23 an internet site.
  4 24    The bill includes in the prohibition the use of a global
  4 25 positioning system or navigation system on an electronic
  4 26 communication device, and exempts the use of an electronic
  4 27 communication device for the purpose of reporting an emergency
  4 28 situation, or by pressing a single button to initiate or
  4 29 terminate a voice communication.
  4 30    The bill eliminates the provision prohibiting a peace
  4 31 officer from stopping or detaining a person solely for a
  4 32 suspected violation of Code section 321.276, and makes a
  4 33 violation of Code section 321.276 a moving violation. Under
  4 34 current law, a moving violation can be considered for purposes
  4 35 of administrative suspension of a driver's license or to
  5  1 establish habitual offender status.
  5  2    The bill rewords the applicable scheduled fine provision
  5  3 to comply with the bill. The scheduled fine for a violation
  5  4 of Code section 321.276 remains $30. Under Code section
  5  5 321.482A, if the violation causes a serious injury, a court
  5  6 could impose an additional fine of $500 or suspend the person's
  5  7 driver's license for not more than 90 days, or both. If the
  5  8 violation causes a death, a court could impose an additional
  5  9 fine of $1,000 or suspend the person's driver's license for not
  5 10 more than 180 days, or both. The bill provides that a person
