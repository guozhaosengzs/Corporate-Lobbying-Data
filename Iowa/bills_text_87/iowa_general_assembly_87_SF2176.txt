  3 11    The bill does not change the current offense of lascivious

  2 15 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 16    This bill relates to the criminal offense of lascivious
  2 17 conduct with a minor.
  2 18    Under the bill, a person commits lascivious conduct with
  2 19 a minor (a person 14 or 15 years of age) when a person over
  2 20 18 years of age who is in a position of authority over the
  2 21 minor performs any of the following acts with the minor, with
  2 22 or without consent, for the purpose of arousing or satisfying
  2 23 the sexual desires of either of them: fondle or touch the
  2 24 inner thigh, groin, buttock, anus, or breast of the minor;
  2 25 touch the clothing covering the immediate area of the inner
  2 26 thigh, groin, buttock, anus, or breast of the minor; solicit
  2 27 or permit the minor to fondle or touch the inner thigh, groin,
  2 28 buttock, anus, or breast of the person; or solicit the minor to
  2 29 engage in certain acts prohibited by the bill in Code section
  2 30 709.14(3)(a)(1), (2), or (3). A person who violates this
  2 31 provision commits a serious misdemeanor.
  2 32    A person commits lascivious conduct with a minor (a person
  2 33 14 or 15 years of age) when a person over 18 years of age who
  2 34 is in a position of authority over the minor performs any of

  3  4 person's genitals or pubes; cause the touching of the person's
  3  5 genitals to any part of the body of the minor; solicit the

  3  7 a sex act with the minor; or inflict pain or discomfort upon
  3  8 the minor or permit the minor to inflict pain or discomfort on
  3  9 the person. A person who violates this provision commits an
  3 10 aggravated misdemeanor.
  3 11    The bill does not change the current offense of lascivious
  3 12 conduct with a minor (a person under 18 years of age) which
  3 13 makes it unlawful for a person over 18 years of age who is in
  3 14 a position of authority over the minor to force, persuade,
  3 15 or coerce a minor, with or without consent, to disrobe or
  3 16 partially disrobe for the purpose of arousing or satisfying
  3 17 the sexual desires of either of them.  The current offense is
  3 18 punishable as a serious misdemeanor.
  3 19    A person convicted of lascivious conduct with a minor,
  3 20 regardless of age, must register as a sex offender pursuant to
  3 21 Code chapter 692A.

  3 10 aggravated misdemeanor.
  3 11    The bill does not change the current offense of lascivious
  3 12 conduct with a minor (a person under 18 years of age) which
  3 13 makes it unlawful for a person over 18 years of age who is in

  3  8 the minor or permit the minor to inflict pain or discomfort on
  3  9 the person. A person who violates this provision commits an
  3 10 aggravated misdemeanor.
  3 11    The bill does not change the current offense of lascivious
  3 12 conduct with a minor (a person under 18 years of age) which
  3 13 makes it unlawful for a person over 18 years of age who is in
