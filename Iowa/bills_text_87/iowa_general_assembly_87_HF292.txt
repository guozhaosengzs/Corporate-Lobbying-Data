  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to custody and support of a child.
  4  1 The bill directs the state registrar to include with the
  4  2 birth certificate application, a separate statement, to be
  4  3 attested to by any parent and submitted to the state registrar,
  4  4 that in accordance with Code section 252A.3, the parent is
  4  5 liable for support of the child.  The statement is also to
  4  6 provide notification to a parent that failure to comply with
  4  7 this provision may subject the parent to a proceeding to compel
  4  8 support and that failure or refusal to provide support for the
  4  9 person's child may be grounds for the crime of nonsupport,
  4 10 which is a class "D" felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable
  4 11 by confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at
  4 12 least $750 but not more than $7,500. The signed attestation
  4 13 submitted to the state registrar is considered a confidential
  4 14 record. The birth certificate application is also to include
  4 15 separate contact information for state agencies, including
  4 16 but not limited to the department of workforce development,
  4 17 that assist individuals in finding employment and a detachable
  4 18 checkoff for a parent who is unemployed to request assistance
  4 19 in finding employment.
  4 20    The bill amends Code section 144.13 to require a mother
  4 21 who was not married at the time of the conception, birth, and
  4 22 at any time during the period between conception and birth
  4 23 to enter the name of the father on the certificate of birth,
  4 24 unless the mother files an affidavit, under penalty of perjury,
  4 25 attesting to not knowing who the father is or attesting that
  4 26 she has made a good=faith effort to identify the father but
  4 27 was unable to do so as supported by evidence demonstrating
  4 28 the good=faith effort, or if good cause is shown.  The bill
  4 29 provides that if a mother files the affidavit or asserts good
  4 30 cause in refusing to enter the name of the father on the birth
  4 31 certificate, upon receipt of the birth certificate by the state
  4 32 registrar, the state registrar shall forward the claim and any
  4 33 supporting evidence to the department of human services (DHS)
  4 34 for investigation.  If the mother's claim and the investigation
  4 35 of the supporting evidence satisfies DHS, DHS is required to
  5  1 grant the exemption and notify the state registrar.  The bill
  5  2 specifies what constitutes "good cause", what constitutes
  5  3 evidence supporting a claim of "good cause", and directs DHS
  5  4 to adopt rules to specify the documentation necessary for a
  5  5 good=faith effort claim. The affidavits, good cause claim, and
  5  6 supporting evidence are confidential records. The department's
  5  7 decision is final agency action and subject to judicial review.
  5  8    The bill directs DHS to establish as a prerequisite for
  5  9 application for the family investment program or the medical
  5 10 assistance program that the entity receiving the application
  5 11 verifies that any child who is included in the family unit has

  3 32                           EXPLANATION
  3 33 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 34 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 35    This bill relates to custody and support of a child.
  4  1 The bill directs the state registrar to include with the
  4  2 birth certificate application, a separate statement, to be
  4  3 attested to by any parent and submitted to the state registrar,
  4  4 that in accordance with Code section 252A.3, the parent is
  4  5 liable for support of the child.  The statement is also to
  4  6 provide notification to a parent that failure to comply with
  4  7 this provision may subject the parent to a proceeding to compel
  4  8 support and that failure or refusal to provide support for the
  4  9 person's child may be grounds for the crime of nonsupport,
  4 10 which is a class "D" felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable
  4 11 by confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at
  4 12 least $750 but not more than $7,500. The signed attestation
  4 13 submitted to the state registrar is considered a confidential
  4 14 record. The birth certificate application is also to include
  4 15 separate contact information for state agencies, including
  4 16 but not limited to the department of workforce development,
  4 17 that assist individuals in finding employment and a detachable
  4 18 checkoff for a parent who is unemployed to request assistance
  4 19 in finding employment.
  4 20    The bill amends Code section 144.13 to require a mother
  4 21 who was not married at the time of the conception, birth, and
  4 22 at any time during the period between conception and birth
  4 23 to enter the name of the father on the certificate of birth,
  4 24 unless the mother files an affidavit, under penalty of perjury,
  4 25 attesting to not knowing who the father is or attesting that
  4 26 she has made a good=faith effort to identify the father but
  4 27 was unable to do so as supported by evidence demonstrating
  4 28 the good=faith effort, or if good cause is shown.  The bill
  4 29 provides that if a mother files the affidavit or asserts good
  4 30 cause in refusing to enter the name of the father on the birth
  4 31 certificate, upon receipt of the birth certificate by the state
  4 32 registrar, the state registrar shall forward the claim and any
  4 33 supporting evidence to the department of human services (DHS)
  4 34 for investigation.  If the mother's claim and the investigation
  4 35 of the supporting evidence satisfies DHS, DHS is required to
  5  1 grant the exemption and notify the state registrar.  The bill
  5  2 specifies what constitutes "good cause", what constitutes
  5  3 evidence supporting a claim of "good cause", and directs DHS
  5  4 to adopt rules to specify the documentation necessary for a
  5  5 good=faith effort claim. The affidavits, good cause claim, and
  5  6 supporting evidence are confidential records. The department's
  5  7 decision is final agency action and subject to judicial review.
  5  8    The bill directs DHS to establish as a prerequisite for
  5  9 application for the family investment program or the medical
  5 10 assistance program that the entity receiving the application
  5 11 verifies that any child who is included in the family unit has
  5 12 a completed birth certificate pursuant to Code section 144.13,
  5 13 unless an exemption was granted based on the affidavit filed by
  5 14 the mother or for good cause. If DHS determines that the birth
  5 15 certificate is not complete and an exemption was not granted,
  5 16 the department shall deny the application for assistance and
  5 17 inform the applicant of the denial. The department's decision

  4  1 The bill directs the state registrar to include with the
  4  2 birth certificate application, a separate statement, to be
  4  3 attested to by any parent and submitted to the state registrar,
  4  4 that in accordance with Code section 252A.3, the parent is
  4  5 liable for support of the child.  The statement is also to
  4  6 provide notification to a parent that failure to comply with
  4  7 this provision may subject the parent to a proceeding to compel
  4  8 support and that failure or refusal to provide support for the
  4  9 person's child may be grounds for the crime of nonsupport,
  4 10 which is a class "D" felony.  A class "D" felony is punishable
  4 11 by confinement for no more than five years and a fine of at
  4 12 least $750 but not more than $7,500. The signed attestation
  4 13 submitted to the state registrar is considered a confidential
  4 14 record. The birth certificate application is also to include
  4 15 separate contact information for state agencies, including
  4 16 but not limited to the department of workforce development,
  4 17 that assist individuals in finding employment and a detachable
  4 18 checkoff for a parent who is unemployed to request assistance
  4 19 in finding employment.

  4 25 attesting to not knowing who the father is or attesting that
  4 26 she has made a good=faith effort to identify the father but
  4 27 was unable to do so as supported by evidence demonstrating
