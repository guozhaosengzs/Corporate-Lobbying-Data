several
provisions
6


in
Code
chapter
543B,
dealing
with
the
licensure
of
real
estate
7


brokers
and
salespersons.

The
bill
changes
references
to
“real

broker”,
“broker
9


associate”,
or
“salesperson”

Code
chapter
543B
to
10


“real

“licensee”.
11


Code
section

prohibits
a

doing
any
act
12


as
a
real
estate
broker
or
representing
oneself
as
a
licensee
13


without
obtaining
a
license.
The
bill
changes
the
prohibition
14


against
doing
any
act
as
a
real
estate
broker
to
a
prohibition
15


against
doing
any
act
constituting
dealing
in
real
estate.
16


The
bill
removes
the
requirement
that
at
least
one
member
17


or
officer
of
a
licensed
brokerage
be
a
real
estate
broker
and
18

being
granted
a
license
to
“brokerage”
in
Code

section
543B.3
defines
“real

broker”
and
21


lists
the

that
a

The
bill
22


modifies
this
provision
to
include
the
same
list
of
acts
as
23


the
definition
of
“brokerage
services”.
The
bill
removes
the
24


definition
of
“brokerage

in
Code
section
543B.5.
The
25


bill
makes
conforming
changes

an
applicant
convicted
29

An
applicant
1


convicted
of
any
other
offense
involving
moral
turpitude
must
2


wait
one
year.
The
bill
provides
that
a
copy
of
the
record
3


of
an
applicant’s
conviction
is
conclusive
evidence
of
the
4


conviction.
5


The
bill
prohibits
the
real
estate
commission
from
requiring
6


an
applicant
to
disclose
criminal
background
information
on
7


an
application
except
for
a
copy
of
conviction
of
certain
8


prescribed
offenses.
The
bill
requires
an
application
to
9


include
an
applicant’s
present
mailing
address
and
electronic
10


mail
address.
A
salesperson’s
application
must
include
11


a
written
statement
from
a
designated
broker.
The
bill
12


eliminates
an
applicant’s
ability
to
immediately
apply
to
13


take
the
next
available
licensure
examination
after
failing
a
14


licensure

a
nonresident
to
become
licensed
16


as
a

met.
The

specifies
that
the
person
must
hold
a
valid
18


and
active
license
to
engage
in
brokerage
services
in
another
19


state.
The

“nonresident”
to
“out-of-state

with
respect
to
such

21


Code

requires
a
salesperson’s
license
22


to
be
delivered
to
the
salesperson’s

and
requires
a
24


license
to
be
delivered
to
and
in
the
custody
of
a
licensee’s
25


brokerage.
26


The
bill
repeals
Code
section
543B.25,
which
requires
a
27


licensed
broker
to
display
their
license
in
the
broker’s

that
the

automatically
suspends
a
