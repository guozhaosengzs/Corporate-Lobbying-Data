  1 29                           EXPLANATION
  1 30 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1 31 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1 32    Current law provides that when a security interest on a motor
  1 33 vehicle is discharged, other than a security interest that has
  1 34 been delivered by electronic means, the holder is required to
  1 35 note the cancellation of the security interest on the face of
  2  1 the vehicle's certificate of title over the holder's signature
  2  2 and deliver the certificate of title to the county treasurer
  2  3 where the title was issued.
  2  4    This bill permits the holder of the security interest to
  2  5 instead note the cancellation of the security interest on a
  2  6 separate, notarized release form or letter and deliver the form
  2  7 or letter along with the certificate of title to the county
  2  8 treasurer where the title was issued. The county treasurer
  2  9 must then deliver the certificate of title and the form or
  2 10 letter to the first secured party, the owner, or the owner's
  2 11 designee, as applicable.
