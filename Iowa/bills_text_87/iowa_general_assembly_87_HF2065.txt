  1  4 animal is being subjected to animal cruelty shall complete an
  1  5 animal cruelty report and submit the report to a local law
  1  6 enforcement agency having jurisdiction to investigate the
  1  7 matter.  The local law enforcement agency shall file the report

  1 15 state law as enforced by the department of agriculture and land
  1 16 stewardship and under federal law as enforced by the United
  1 17 States department of agriculture.  The conclusion must at least

  1 19 constitute elements of animal abuse in the first degree as
  1 20 described in section 717B.2, subsection 1, or animal torture as
  1 21 described in section 717B.3A, subsection 1.
  1 22    c.  Notwithstanding section 169.3, for purposes of this

  2  7 necessary for a law enforcement officer to interview the person
  2  8 submitting the report and conduct an investigation regarding

 11  8                           EXPLANATION
 11  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 11    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 12 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 13 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 14 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 15 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 16 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 17 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 18 481A.42).
 11 19    The bill amends or creates three criminal offenses,
 11 20 including animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended
 11 21 Code section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), and animal
 11 22 torture (amended Code section 717B.3A).  The bill applies in
 11 23 part to the offense of animal neglect (Code section 717B.3)
 11 24 but does not amend the statute. Each of the amended or new
 11 25 offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
 11 26 convicted person in either of two situations:  (1) the person
 11 27 is an adult who committed the offense in the presence of a
 11 28 juvenile or (2) the person has previously committed any of the
 11 29 offenses previously described (abuse, torture, or neglect);
 11 30 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 11 31 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 11 32 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 11 33 section 717D.2); or committed any similar offense in another
 11 34 state.
 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class
 12 16 "C" felony.
 12 17    A number of exceptions remain applicable to the animal abuse
 12 18 and animal torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court
 12 19 order; (2) a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry
 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 13  4 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 13  5 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 13  6 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 13  7 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 13  8 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13  9 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 13 14 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 13 17 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 13 18 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 13 19 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 13 20 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 13 21 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 13 22 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 13 23 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 13 24 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 13 25 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 13 26 felony.
 13 27    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 13 28 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 13 29 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 13 30 to animal abuse or animal torture.  The board of veterinary
 13 31 medicine may prescribe the form of the report.  The report
 13 32 must be submitted to the local law enforcement agency  having
 13 33 jurisdiction of the matter.
 13 34    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 13 35 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 14  1 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 14  2 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 14  3 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 14  4 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 14  5 witnessed the offense being committed.
 14  6    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 14  7 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 14  8 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 14  9 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 14 10 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 14 11 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 14 12 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 11 13 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 14 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 15 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 16 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 17 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 18 481A.42).
 11 19    The bill amends or creates three criminal offenses,
 11 20 including animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended
 11 21 Code section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), and animal
 11 22 torture (amended Code section 717B.3A).  The bill applies in
 11 23 part to the offense of animal neglect (Code section 717B.3)
 11 24 but does not amend the statute. Each of the amended or new
 11 25 offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
 11 26 convicted person in either of two situations:  (1) the person
 11 27 is an adult who committed the offense in the presence of a
 11 28 juvenile or (2) the person has previously committed any of the
 11 29 offenses previously described (abuse, torture, or neglect);
 11 30 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 11 31 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 11 32 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 11 33 section 717D.2); or committed any similar offense in another
 11 34 state.
 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class
 12 16 "C" felony.
 12 17    A number of exceptions remain applicable to the animal abuse
 12 18 and animal torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court
 12 19 order; (2) a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry
 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 13  4 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 13  5 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 13  6 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 13  7 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 13  8 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13  9 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 13 14 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 13 17 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 13 18 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 13 19 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 13 20 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 13 21 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 13 22 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 13 23 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 13 24 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 13 25 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 13 26 felony.
 13 27    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 13 28 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 13 29 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 13 30 to animal abuse or animal torture.  The board of veterinary
 13 31 medicine may prescribe the form of the report.  The report
 13 32 must be submitted to the local law enforcement agency  having
 13 33 jurisdiction of the matter.
 13 34    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 13 35 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 14  1 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 14  2 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 14  3 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 14  4 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 14  5 witnessed the offense being committed.
 14  6    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 14  7 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 14  8 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 14  9 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 14 10 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 14 11 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to

 11  8                           EXPLANATION
 11  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 11    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 12 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 13 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 14 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 15 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 16 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 17 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 18 481A.42).
 11 19    The bill amends or creates three criminal offenses,
 11 20 including animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended
 11 21 Code section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), and animal
 11 22 torture (amended Code section 717B.3A).  The bill applies in
 11 23 part to the offense of animal neglect (Code section 717B.3)
 11 24 but does not amend the statute. Each of the amended or new
 11 25 offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
 11 26 convicted person in either of two situations:  (1) the person
 11 27 is an adult who committed the offense in the presence of a
 11 28 juvenile or (2) the person has previously committed any of the
 11 29 offenses previously described (abuse, torture, or neglect);
 11 30 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 11 31 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 11 32 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 11 33 section 717D.2); or committed any similar offense in another
 11 34 state.
 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class
 12 16 "C" felony.
 12 17    A number of exceptions remain applicable to the animal abuse
 12 18 and animal torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court
 12 19 order; (2) a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry
 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 13  4 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 13  5 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 13  6 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 13  7 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 13  8 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13  9 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 13 14 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 13 17 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 13 18 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 13 19 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 13 20 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 13 21 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 13 22 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 13 23 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 13 24 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 13 25 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 13 26 felony.
 13 27    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 13 28 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 13 29 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 13 30 to animal abuse or animal torture.  The board of veterinary
 13 31 medicine may prescribe the form of the report.  The report
 13 32 must be submitted to the local law enforcement agency  having
 13 33 jurisdiction of the matter.
 13 34    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 13 35 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 14  1 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 14  2 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 14  3 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 14  4 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 14  5 witnessed the offense being committed.
 14  6    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 14  7 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 14  8 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 14  9 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 14 10 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 14 11 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 14 12 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 11  1    b.  The report shall be filed in a manner and according to
 11  2 procedures required by the department of human services.

 11  8                           EXPLANATION
 11  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 11    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 12 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 13 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 14 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 15 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 16 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 17 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 18 481A.42).
 11 19    The bill amends or creates three criminal offenses,
 11 20 including animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended
 11 21 Code section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), and animal
 11 22 torture (amended Code section 717B.3A).  The bill applies in
 11 23 part to the offense of animal neglect (Code section 717B.3)
 11 24 but does not amend the statute. Each of the amended or new
 11 25 offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
 11 26 convicted person in either of two situations:  (1) the person
 11 27 is an adult who committed the offense in the presence of a
 11 28 juvenile or (2) the person has previously committed any of the
 11 29 offenses previously described (abuse, torture, or neglect);
 11 30 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 11 31 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 11 32 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 11 33 section 717D.2); or committed any similar offense in another
 11 34 state.
 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class
 12 16 "C" felony.
 12 17    A number of exceptions remain applicable to the animal abuse
 12 18 and animal torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court
 12 19 order; (2) a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry
 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 13  4 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 13  5 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 13  6 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 13  7 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 13  8 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13  9 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 13 14 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 13 17 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 13 18 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 13 19 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 13 20 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 13 21 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 13 22 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 13 23 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 13 24 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 13 25 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 13 26 felony.
 13 27    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 13 28 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 13 29 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 13 30 to animal abuse or animal torture.  The board of veterinary
 13 31 medicine may prescribe the form of the report.  The report
 13 32 must be submitted to the local law enforcement agency  having
 13 33 jurisdiction of the matter.
 13 34    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 13 35 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 14  1 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 14  2 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 14  3 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 14  4 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 14  5 witnessed the offense being committed.
 14  6    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 14  7 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 14  8 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 14  9 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 14 10 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 14 11 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 14 12 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 11  5 22.7, subsection 5.

 11  8                           EXPLANATION
 11  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 11    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 12 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 13 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 14 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 15 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 16 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 17 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 18 481A.42).
 11 19    The bill amends or creates three criminal offenses,
 11 20 including animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended
 11 21 Code section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), and animal
 11 22 torture (amended Code section 717B.3A).  The bill applies in
 11 23 part to the offense of animal neglect (Code section 717B.3)
 11 24 but does not amend the statute. Each of the amended or new
 11 25 offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
 11 26 convicted person in either of two situations:  (1) the person
 11 27 is an adult who committed the offense in the presence of a
 11 28 juvenile or (2) the person has previously committed any of the
 11 29 offenses previously described (abuse, torture, or neglect);
 11 30 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 11 31 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 11 32 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 11 33 section 717D.2); or committed any similar offense in another
 11 34 state.
 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class
 12 16 "C" felony.
 12 17    A number of exceptions remain applicable to the animal abuse
 12 18 and animal torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court
 12 19 order; (2) a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry
 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 13  4 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 13  5 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 13  6 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 13  7 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 13  8 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13  9 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 13 14 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 13 17 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 13 18 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 13 19 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 13 20 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 13 21 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 13 22 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 13 23 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 13 24 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 13 25 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 13 26 felony.
 13 27    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 13 28 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 13 29 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 13 30 to animal abuse or animal torture.  The board of veterinary
 13 31 medicine may prescribe the form of the report.  The report
 13 32 must be submitted to the local law enforcement agency  having
 13 33 jurisdiction of the matter.
 13 34    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 13 35 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 14  1 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 14  2 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 14  3 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 14  4 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 14  5 witnessed the offense being committed.
 14  6    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 14  7 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 14  8 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 14  9 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 14 10 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 14 11 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 14 12 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 11 19    The bill amends or creates three criminal offenses,
 11 20 including animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended
 11 21 Code section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), and animal
 11 22 torture (amended Code section 717B.3A).  The bill applies in
 11 23 part to the offense of animal neglect (Code section 717B.3)
 11 24 but does not amend the statute. Each of the amended or new
 11 25 offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
 11 26 convicted person in either of two situations:  (1) the person
 11 27 is an adult who committed the offense in the presence of a
 11 28 juvenile or (2) the person has previously committed any of the
 11 29 offenses previously described (abuse, torture, or neglect);
 11 30 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 11 31 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 11 32 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 11 33 section 717D.2); or committed any similar offense in another
 11 34 state.
 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class
 12 16 "C" felony.
 12 17    A number of exceptions remain applicable to the animal abuse
 12 18 and animal torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court
 12 19 order; (2) a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry
 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 13  4 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 13  5 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 13  6 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 13  7 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 13  8 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13  9 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 13 14 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 13 17 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 13 18 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 13 19 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 13 20 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 13 21 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 13 22 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 13 23 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 13 24 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 13 25 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 13 26 felony.
 13 27    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 13 28 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 13 29 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 13 30 to animal abuse or animal torture.  The board of veterinary
 13 31 medicine may prescribe the form of the report.  The report
 13 32 must be submitted to the local law enforcement agency  having
 13 33 jurisdiction of the matter.
 13 34    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 13 35 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 14  1 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 14  2 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 14  3 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 14  4 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 14  5 witnessed the offense being committed.
 14  6    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 14  7 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 14  8 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 14  9 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 14 10 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 14 11 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 14 12 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class
 12 16 "C" felony.
 12 17    A number of exceptions remain applicable to the animal abuse
 12 18 and animal torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court
 12 19 order; (2) a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry
 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 13  4 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 13  5 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 13  6 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 13  7 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 13  8 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13  9 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 13 14 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 13 17 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 13 18 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 13 19 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 13 20 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 13 21 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 13 22 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 13 23 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 13 24 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 13 25 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 13 26 felony.
 13 27    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 13 28 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 13 29 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 13 30 to animal abuse or animal torture.  The board of veterinary
 13 31 medicine may prescribe the form of the report.  The report
 13 32 must be submitted to the local law enforcement agency  having
 13 33 jurisdiction of the matter.
 13 34    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 13 35 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 14  1 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 14  2 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 14  3 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 14  4 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 14  5 witnessed the offense being committed.
 14  6    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 14  7 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 14  8 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 14  9 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 14 10 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 14 11 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 14 12 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 11 11    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 12 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 13 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 14 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 15 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 16 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 17 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 18 481A.42).
 11 19    The bill amends or creates three criminal offenses,
 11 20 including animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended
 11 21 Code section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), and animal
 11 22 torture (amended Code section 717B.3A).  The bill applies in
 11 23 part to the offense of animal neglect (Code section 717B.3)
 11 24 but does not amend the statute. Each of the amended or new
 11 25 offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
 11 26 convicted person in either of two situations:  (1) the person
 11 27 is an adult who committed the offense in the presence of a
 11 28 juvenile or (2) the person has previously committed any of the
 11 29 offenses previously described (abuse, torture, or neglect);
 11 30 committed injury or interference with a police service dog

 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,

 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.

 11 21 Code section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), and animal
 11 22 torture (amended Code section 717B.3A).  The bill applies in

 11 31 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 11 32 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 11 33 section 717D.2); or committed any similar offense in another
 11 34 state.
 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class

 12 17    A number of exceptions remain applicable to the animal abuse
 12 18 and animal torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court
 12 19 order; (2) a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry
 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 13 14 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 13 17 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an

 11  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 11    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 12 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 13 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 14 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 15 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 16 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 17 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 18 481A.42).
 11 19    The bill amends or creates three criminal offenses,
 11 20 including animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended
 11 21 Code section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), and animal
 11 22 torture (amended Code section 717B.3A).  The bill applies in
 11 23 part to the offense of animal neglect (Code section 717B.3)
 11 24 but does not amend the statute. Each of the amended or new
 11 25 offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
 11 26 convicted person in either of two situations:  (1) the person
 11 27 is an adult who committed the offense in the presence of a
 11 28 juvenile or (2) the person has previously committed any of the
 11 29 offenses previously described (abuse, torture, or neglect);
 11 30 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 11 31 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 11 32 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 11 33 section 717D.2); or committed any similar offense in another
 11 34 state.
 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class
 12 16 "C" felony.
 12 17    A number of exceptions remain applicable to the animal abuse
 12 18 and animal torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court
 12 19 order; (2) a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry
 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 13  4 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 13  5 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 13  6 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 13  7 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 13  8 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13  9 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 13 14 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 13 17 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 13 18 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 13 19 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 13 20 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 13 21 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 13 22 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 13 23 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 13 24 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 13 25 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 13 26 felony.

 13 32 must be submitted to the local law enforcement agency  having
 13 33 jurisdiction of the matter.
 13 34    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 13 35 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 14  1 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 14  2 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 14  3 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 14  4 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 14  5 witnessed the offense being committed.
 14  6    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 14  7 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 14  8 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 14  9 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 14 10 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 14 11 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 14 12 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 11 11    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 12 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 13 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 14 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 15 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 16 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 17 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 18 481A.42).
 11 19    The bill amends or creates three criminal offenses,
 11 20 including animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended
 11 21 Code section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), and animal
 11 22 torture (amended Code section 717B.3A).  The bill applies in
 11 23 part to the offense of animal neglect (Code section 717B.3)
 11 24 but does not amend the statute. Each of the amended or new
 11 25 offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
 11 26 convicted person in either of two situations:  (1) the person
 11 27 is an adult who committed the offense in the presence of a
 11 28 juvenile or (2) the person has previously committed any of the
 11 29 offenses previously described (abuse, torture, or neglect);
 11 30 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 11 31 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 11 32 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 11 33 section 717D.2); or committed any similar offense in another
 11 34 state.
 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class
 12 16 "C" felony.
 12 17    A number of exceptions remain applicable to the animal abuse
 12 18 and animal torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court
 12 19 order; (2) a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry
 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 13  4 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 13  5 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 13  6 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 13  7 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 13  8 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13  9 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 13 14 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 13 17 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 13 18 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 13 19 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 13 20 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 13 21 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 13 22 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 13 23 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:

 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated

 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more

 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order

 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary

 13 18 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 13 19 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is

 11  8                           EXPLANATION
 11  9 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 10 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 11    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 12 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 13 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 14 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 15 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 16 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 17 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 18 481A.42).
 11 19    The bill amends or creates three criminal offenses,
 11 20 including animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended
 11 21 Code section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), and animal
 11 22 torture (amended Code section 717B.3A).  The bill applies in
 11 23 part to the offense of animal neglect (Code section 717B.3)
 11 24 but does not amend the statute. Each of the amended or new
 11 25 offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
 11 26 convicted person in either of two situations:  (1) the person
 11 27 is an adult who committed the offense in the presence of a
 11 28 juvenile or (2) the person has previously committed any of the
 11 29 offenses previously described (abuse, torture, or neglect);
 11 30 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 11 31 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 11 32 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 11 33 section 717D.2); or committed any similar offense in another
 11 34 state.
 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class
 12 16 "C" felony.
 12 17    A number of exceptions remain applicable to the animal abuse
 12 18 and animal torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court
 12 19 order; (2) a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry
 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 13  4 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 13  5 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 13  6 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 13  7 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 13  8 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13  9 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 13 14 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 13 17 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 13 18 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 13 19 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 13 20 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 13 21 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 13 22 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 13 23 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 13 24 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 13 25 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 13 26 felony.
 13 27    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== VETERINARIANS TO LOCAL LAW
 13 28 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 13 29 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 13 30 to animal abuse or animal torture.  The board of veterinary
 13 31 medicine may prescribe the form of the report.  The report
 13 32 must be submitted to the local law enforcement agency  having
 13 33 jurisdiction of the matter.
 13 34    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 13 35 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 14  1 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 14  2 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 14  3 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 14  4 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 14  5 witnessed the offense being committed.
 14  6    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 14  7 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 14  8 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 14  9 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 14 10 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or
 14 11 specified.  Therefore, political subdivisions are required to
 14 12 comply with any state mandate included in the bill.

 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which

 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are

 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 13 14 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary

 13 18 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 13 19 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 13 20 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 13 21 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 13 22 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a

 13 28 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  A veterinarian is required to report
 13 29 cases in which an animal may have suffered a serious injury due
 13 30 to animal abuse or animal torture.  The board of veterinary
 13 31 medicine may prescribe the form of the report.  The report
 13 32 must be submitted to the local law enforcement agency  having
 13 33 jurisdiction of the matter.
 13 34    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 13 35 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency

 11 11    GENERAL.  This bill amends Code chapter 717B prohibiting
 11 12 the mistreatment of certain animals, including dogs and cats,
 11 13 but excluding other animals such as livestock (Code chapter
 11 14 717); game, fur=bearing animals, fish, reptiles, or amphibians
 11 15 (Code chapter 481A), unless such animal is owned, confined,
 11 16 or controlled by a person; or a nongame animal declared to be
 11 17 a nuisance by the natural resource commission (Code section
 11 18 481A.42).
 11 19    The bill amends or creates three criminal offenses,
 11 20 including animal abuse in the first or second degree (amended
 11 21 Code section 717B.2 and new Code section 717B.2A), and animal
 11 22 torture (amended Code section 717B.3A).  The bill applies in
 11 23 part to the offense of animal neglect (Code section 717B.3)
 11 24 but does not amend the statute. Each of the amended or new
 11 25 offenses includes an enhanced penalty that applies to a
 11 26 convicted person in either of two situations:  (1) the person
 11 27 is an adult who committed the offense in the presence of a
 11 28 juvenile or (2) the person has previously committed any of the
 11 29 offenses previously described (abuse, torture, or neglect);
 11 30 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 11 31 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 11 32 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 11 33 section 717D.2); or committed any similar offense in another
 11 34 state.
 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class
 12 16 "C" felony.
 12 17    A number of exceptions remain applicable to the animal abuse
 12 18 and animal torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court
 12 19 order; (2) a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry
 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 13  4 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 13  5 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 13  6 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 13  7 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 13  8 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13  9 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order

 13 20 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 13 21 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 13 22 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 13 23 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 13 24 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to

 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class
 12 16 "C" felony.
 12 17    A number of exceptions remain applicable to the animal abuse
 12 18 and animal torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court
 12 19 order; (2) a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry
 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 13  4 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 13  5 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 13  6 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 13  7 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 13  8 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13  9 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 13 14 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 13 17 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 13 18 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 13 19 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 13 20 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 13 21 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 13 22 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 13 23 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 13 24 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to
 13 25 15 years for a class "D" felony, and (3) life for a class "C"
 13 26 felony.

 13 32 must be submitted to the local law enforcement agency  having
 13 33 jurisdiction of the matter.
 13 34    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 13 35 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 14  1 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 14  2 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 14  3 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 14  4 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 14  5 witnessed the offense being committed.
 14  6    STATE MANDATE.  The bill may include a state mandate as
 14  7 defined in Code section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable
 14  8 Code section 25B.2, subsection 3, which would relieve a
 14  9 political subdivision from complying with a state mandate if
 14 10 funding for the cost of the state mandate is not provided or

 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which

 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or

 11 27 is an adult who committed the offense in the presence of a
 11 28 juvenile or (2) the person has previously committed any of the
 11 29 offenses previously described (abuse, torture, or neglect);
 11 30 committed injury or interference with a police service dog
 11 31 (Code section 717B.9); committed bestiality (Code section
 11 32 717C.1); committed an offense involving an animal contest (Code
 11 33 section 717D.2); or committed any similar offense in another
 11 34 state.
 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class

 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;

 13  9 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order

 11 33 section 717D.2); or committed any similar offense in another
 11 34 state.
 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class
 12 16 "C" felony.
 12 17    A number of exceptions remain applicable to the animal abuse
 12 18 and animal torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court

 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;

 13  7 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 13  8 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13  9 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 13 14 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary

 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class
 12 16 "C" felony.
 12 17    A number of exceptions remain applicable to the animal abuse
 12 18 and animal torture offenses, including carrying out (1) a court
 12 19 order; (2) a veterinary practice; (3) a good animal husbandry
 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
 13  4 (3) aggravated misdemeanor, confinement for no more than two
 13  5 years and a fine of at least $625 but not more than $6,250; (4)
 13  6 class "D" felony, confinement for no more than five years and a
 13  7 fine of at least $750 but not more than $7,500; and (5) class
 13  8 "C" felony, confinement for no more than 10 years and a fine of
 13  9 at least $1,000 but not more than $10,000.
 13 10    COURT ORDERS.  At the time of conviction for committing
 13 11 any of the offenses, a person may be subject to a court order
 13 12 requiring a psychological or psychiatric evaluation and
 13 13 treatment.  The person may also be subject to a court order
 13 14 prohibiting the person from owning, possessing, or living with
 13 15 an animal of the same genus as the mistreated animal.  In each
 13 16 case, the court's decision to issue an order is discretionary
 13 17 except under certain conditions.  A court order requiring an
 13 18 evaluation and treatment is mandatory for juveniles.  That
 13 19 order and the order prohibiting contact with animals is
 13 20 also mandatory if the offense is punishable as an aggravated
 13 21 misdemeanor or felony.  For a discretionary court order,
 13 22 the  period of prohibition is from one to five years.  For a
 13 23 mandatory court order, the period of prohibition is as follows:
 13 24 (1)  one to five years for an aggravated misdemeanor, (2) 5 to

 13 31 medicine may prescribe the form of the report.  The report
 13 32 must be submitted to the local law enforcement agency  having
 13 33 jurisdiction of the matter.
 13 34    MANDATORY REPORTING ==== LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO THE
 13 35 DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES.  A local law enforcement agency
 14  1 must submit a report to the department of human services if a
 14  2 law enforcement officer conducts an investigation involving
 14  3 animal abuse, animal neglect, or animal torture and reasonably
 14  4 believes a minor child of the subject of the investigation
 14  5 witnessed the offense being committed.

 11 35    TYPES OF CRIMINAL OFFENSES ==== ABUSE, TORTURE, AND NEGLECT.
 12  1 Animal abuse involves injuring an animal by violence or
 12  2 poisoning; and animal torture involves inflicting upon the
 12  3 animal severe and prolonged or repeated physical pain.  For
 12  4 animal abuse in the first degree or animal torture, the
 12  5 animal must suffer a serious injury or death. Serious injury
 12  6 involves a substantial risk of death, protracted disfigurement,
 12  7 impairment, or a loss or impairment of a limb. For animal
 12  8 abuse in the second degree, the animal must suffer an injury
 12  9 meaning some impairment to the animal's health or functions,
 12 10 or death. For these offenses, the criminal penalties are as
 12 11 follows:  (1) animal abuse in the first degree, an aggravated
 12 12 misdemeanor which may be enhanced to a class "D" felony; (2)
 12 13 animal abuse in the second degree, a serious misdemeanor which
 12 14 may be enhanced to an aggravated misdemeanor; and (3) animal
 12 15 torture, a class "D" felony which may be enhanced to a class
 12 16 "C" felony.

 12 20 practice; (4) another provision of law; (5) legally hunting,
 12 21 trapping, or fishing; (6) a defense of property or life; (7)
 12 22 conduct by a local authority; and (8) research activities.  The
 12 23 bill eliminates a provision in the current abuse Code section
 12 24 that excepts an animal's owner from culpability.  The bill also
 12 25 eliminates an element of animal torture that requires proof of
 12 26 sadistic or depraved intent.
 12 27    Under current law, animal neglect involves failing to
 12 28 provide an animal with adequate food, water, or habitable
 12 29 conditions. A person who negligently or intentionally
 12 30 commits the offense of animal neglect is guilty of a simple
 12 31 misdemeanor. A person who intentionally commits the offense of
 12 32 animal neglect which results in serious injury to or the death
 12 33 of an animal is guilty of a serious misdemeanor.
 12 34    APPLICABLE CRIMINAL PENALTIES.  The criminal penalties are
 12 35 as follows:  (1) simple misdemeanor,  confinement for no more
 13  1 than 30 days or a fine of at least $65 but not more than $625 or
 13  2 by both; (2)  serious misdemeanor, confinement for no more than
 13  3 one year and a fine of at least $315 but not more than $1,875;
