  1 35 date that the United States supreme court issues an opinion
  2  1 or that federal legislation takes effect which abrogates the

  2 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 12    This bill relates to the collection of sales and use taxes
  2 13 by certain out=of=state retailers.  A retailer making taxable
  2 14 sales in Iowa is required to collect sales tax.  For sales made
  2 15 outside Iowa but subject to the use tax, Iowa law requires
  2 16 retailers maintaining a place of business in this state to
  2 17 collect and remit the use tax.
  2 18    Currently, as defined in Code section 423.1, the term
  2 19 "retailer maintaining a place of business in this state"
  2 20 includes retailers that have in Iowa certain physical places
  2 21 of business or representatives operating under the authority
  2 22 of the retailer, and includes a presumption that a retailer is
  2 23 maintaining a place of business in Iowa when any person who has
  2 24 substantial nexus in Iowa meets certain conditions or performs
  2 25 certain acts associated with the retailer.
  2 26    The bill amends the definition of "retailer maintaining
  2 27 a place of business in this state" to also include retailers
  2 28 who do not meet the requirements listed above, but who do have
  2 29 gross revenue from the sale of tangible personal property
  2 30 or services delivered into Iowa in excess of $100,000 for
  2 31 the current or previous calendar year, or who sell tangible
  2 32 personal property or services for delivery into Iowa in 200 or
  2 33 more separate transactions in the current or previous calendar
  2 34 year.
  2 35    The bill takes effect on the later of July 1, 2018, or the
  3  1 first day of the first quarter following the date that the
  3  2 United States supreme court issues an opinion or that federal
  3  3 legislation takes effect which abrogates the physical presence
  3  4 requirement of Quill v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992), or
  3  5 otherwise confirms that a state may constitutionally impose its
  3  6 sales or use tax upon an out=of=state seller in circumstances
  3  7 similar to those in the bill.  In Quill, the United States
  3  8 supreme court held it is a violation of the commerce clause
  3  9 of the United States Constitution for a state to require an
  3 10 out=of=state seller to collect a state's sales or use tax if
  3 11 the seller does not have a physical presence in that state.
  3 12 Because Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce,
  3 13 it has the power to modify or abrogate the holding of Quill
  3 14 through legislation.
  3 15    The bill requires the director of revenue to notify the Iowa
  3 16 Code editor when the contingency is satisfied.

  2 10 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  2 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 12    This bill relates to the collection of sales and use taxes
  2 13 by certain out=of=state retailers.  A retailer making taxable
  2 14 sales in Iowa is required to collect sales tax.  For sales made
  2 15 outside Iowa but subject to the use tax, Iowa law requires
  2 16 retailers maintaining a place of business in this state to
  2 17 collect and remit the use tax.
  2 18    Currently, as defined in Code section 423.1, the term
  2 19 "retailer maintaining a place of business in this state"
  2 20 includes retailers that have in Iowa certain physical places
  2 21 of business or representatives operating under the authority
  2 22 of the retailer, and includes a presumption that a retailer is
  2 23 maintaining a place of business in Iowa when any person who has
  2 24 substantial nexus in Iowa meets certain conditions or performs
  2 25 certain acts associated with the retailer.
  2 26    The bill amends the definition of "retailer maintaining
  2 27 a place of business in this state" to also include retailers
  2 28 who do not meet the requirements listed above, but who do have
  2 29 gross revenue from the sale of tangible personal property
  2 30 or services delivered into Iowa in excess of $100,000 for
  2 31 the current or previous calendar year, or who sell tangible
  2 32 personal property or services for delivery into Iowa in 200 or
  2 33 more separate transactions in the current or previous calendar
  2 34 year.
  2 35    The bill takes effect on the later of July 1, 2018, or the
  3  1 first day of the first quarter following the date that the
  3  2 United States supreme court issues an opinion or that federal
  3  3 legislation takes effect which abrogates the physical presence
  3  4 requirement of Quill v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992), or
  3  5 otherwise confirms that a state may constitutionally impose its
  3  6 sales or use tax upon an out=of=state seller in circumstances
  3  7 similar to those in the bill.  In Quill, the United States
  3  8 supreme court held it is a violation of the commerce clause
  3  9 of the United States Constitution for a state to require an
  3 10 out=of=state seller to collect a state's sales or use tax if
  3 11 the seller does not have a physical presence in that state.
  3 12 Because Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce,
  3 13 it has the power to modify or abrogate the holding of Quill
  3 14 through legislation.
  3 15    The bill requires the director of revenue to notify the Iowa

  2 11 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  2 12    This bill relates to the collection of sales and use taxes
  2 13 by certain out=of=state retailers.  A retailer making taxable
  2 14 sales in Iowa is required to collect sales tax.  For sales made
  2 15 outside Iowa but subject to the use tax, Iowa law requires
  2 16 retailers maintaining a place of business in this state to
  2 17 collect and remit the use tax.
  2 18    Currently, as defined in Code section 423.1, the term
  2 19 "retailer maintaining a place of business in this state"
  2 20 includes retailers that have in Iowa certain physical places
  2 21 of business or representatives operating under the authority
  2 22 of the retailer, and includes a presumption that a retailer is
  2 23 maintaining a place of business in Iowa when any person who has
  2 24 substantial nexus in Iowa meets certain conditions or performs
  2 25 certain acts associated with the retailer.
  2 26    The bill amends the definition of "retailer maintaining
  2 27 a place of business in this state" to also include retailers
  2 28 who do not meet the requirements listed above, but who do have
  2 29 gross revenue from the sale of tangible personal property
  2 30 or services delivered into Iowa in excess of $100,000 for
  2 31 the current or previous calendar year, or who sell tangible
  2 32 personal property or services for delivery into Iowa in 200 or
  2 33 more separate transactions in the current or previous calendar
  2 34 year.
  2 35    The bill takes effect on the later of July 1, 2018, or the
