 11 26 services region created in Code section 331.389 and substance
 11 27 abuse programs licensed pursuant to Code chapter 125, to

 14  7 and the Iowa physician health program for the identification
 14  8 and treatment of licensees who may be at risk for license
 14  9 discipline due to a substance use disorder.
 14 10    The bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse
 14 11 prevention and treatment fund to the department of public
 14 12 health for contracting with the Iowa health care collaborative
 14 13 to develop and pilot protocols for the treatment of emergency

 14 29    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 14 30 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 14 31 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 14 32 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 14 33 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 14 34 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 14 35 mandate included in the bill.

 11 25 cooperation with the relevant mental health and disability
 11 26 services region created in Code section 331.389 and substance
 11 27 abuse programs licensed pursuant to Code chapter 125, to

 13 14 otherwise promote the effective, evidence=based prescription
 13 15 and use of opioids to members receiving benefits through state
 13 16 plans, document the current use of benefits for substance

 14  7 and the Iowa physician health program for the identification
 14  8 and treatment of licensees who may be at risk for license
 14  9 discipline due to a substance use disorder.
 14 10    The bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse
 14 11 prevention and treatment fund to the department of public

 14 29    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 14 30 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 14 31 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

 14 33 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 14 34 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 14 35 mandate included in the bill.

 11 23 county boards of health.
 11 24    The bill requires each county board of health, in
 11 25 cooperation with the relevant mental health and disability
 11 26 services region created in Code section 331.389 and substance
 11 27 abuse programs licensed pursuant to Code chapter 125, to

 13 12 plan administrators of benefits extended to state employees,
 13 13 to create a model benefit plan designed to incentivize or
 13 14 otherwise promote the effective, evidence=based prescription
 13 15 and use of opioids to members receiving benefits through state
 13 16 plans, document the current use of benefits for substance
 13 17 use disorders, identify gaps or unnecessary restrictions in
 13 18 coverage, and expand access to evidence=based treatments and
 13 19 therapies, including nonpharmacological treatments.
 13 20    The bill directs the department of human services and the
 13 21 Iowa Medicaid enterprise, in cooperation with managed care

 13 33 department of human services, to make recommendations to the
 13 34 governor and the general assembly regarding the establishment
 13 35 of recovery high schools for the education of students
 14  1 recovering from substance abuse and related disorders. The
 14  2 bill requires the department of education to submit its
 14  3 recommendations by November 1, 2018.
 14  4    The bill requires each professional licensing board
 14  5 designated in Code section 147.13 to consider the adoption
 14  6 of a program modeled after the Iowa nurse assistance program
 14  7 and the Iowa physician health program for the identification
 14  8 and treatment of licensees who may be at risk for license
 14  9 discipline due to a substance use disorder.
 14 10    The bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse
 14 11 prevention and treatment fund to the department of public
 14 12 health for contracting with the Iowa health care collaborative
 14 13 to develop and pilot protocols for the treatment of emergency
 14 14 room patients experiencing opioid or heroin overdoses

 14 18 behavioral health treatment facilities offering residential
 14 19 substance use disorder treatment for 29 days or more. The
 14 20 bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse prevention and
 14 21 treatment fund to the state board of regents for FY 2018=2019
 14 22 for the funding of research conducted at the college of public

 14 28 state university of Iowa for the nonnarcotic treatment of pain.
 14 29    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 14 30 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 14 31 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 14 32 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 14 33 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 14 34 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 14 35 mandate included in the bill.

 11 25 cooperation with the relevant mental health and disability
 11 26 services region created in Code section 331.389 and substance
 11 27 abuse programs licensed pursuant to Code chapter 125, to

 13 15 and use of opioids to members receiving benefits through state
 13 16 plans, document the current use of benefits for substance
 13 17 use disorders, identify gaps or unnecessary restrictions in

 13 31    The bill directs the department of education, in
 13 32 collaboration with the department of public health and the
 13 33 department of human services, to make recommendations to the
 13 34 governor and the general assembly regarding the establishment
 13 35 of recovery high schools for the education of students
 14  1 recovering from substance abuse and related disorders. The
 14  2 bill requires the department of education to submit its
 14  3 recommendations by November 1, 2018.
 14  4    The bill requires each professional licensing board
 14  5 designated in Code section 147.13 to consider the adoption
 14  6 of a program modeled after the Iowa nurse assistance program
 14  7 and the Iowa physician health program for the identification
 14  8 and treatment of licensees who may be at risk for license
 14  9 discipline due to a substance use disorder.

 14 11 prevention and treatment fund to the department of public
 14 12 health for contracting with the Iowa health care collaborative
 14 13 to develop and pilot protocols for the treatment of emergency
 14 14 room patients experiencing opioid or heroin overdoses

 14 28 state university of Iowa for the nonnarcotic treatment of pain.
 14 29    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 14 30 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 14 31 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 14 32 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 14 33 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 14 34 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 14 35 mandate included in the bill.

 11 26 services region created in Code section 331.389 and substance
 11 27 abuse programs licensed pursuant to Code chapter 125, to

 14 30 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 14 31 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

 10  8 opioids to a patient lasting longer than seven days and
 10  9 prior to issuing a second or subsequent prescription for an
 10 10 opioid to the patient. The bill requires the department of
 10 11 medicine to determine the form and content of the contract but
 10 12 requires that the contract be based on evidence regarding the
 10 13 responsible prescription of opioids.
 10 14    The bill establishes an opioid abuse prevention and
 10 15 treatment workgroup within the department of public health.

 11 23 county boards of health.
 11 24    The bill requires each county board of health, in
 11 25 cooperation with the relevant mental health and disability
 11 26 services region created in Code section 331.389 and substance
 11 27 abuse programs licensed pursuant to Code chapter 125, to
 11 28 include information regarding opioid abuse and substance use

 13 12 plan administrators of benefits extended to state employees,
 13 13 to create a model benefit plan designed to incentivize or
 13 14 otherwise promote the effective, evidence=based prescription
 13 15 and use of opioids to members receiving benefits through state
 13 16 plans, document the current use of benefits for substance
 13 17 use disorders, identify gaps or unnecessary restrictions in
 13 18 coverage, and expand access to evidence=based treatments and
 13 19 therapies, including nonpharmacological treatments.
 13 20    The bill directs the department of human services and the

 13 33 department of human services, to make recommendations to the
 13 34 governor and the general assembly regarding the establishment
 13 35 of recovery high schools for the education of students
 14  1 recovering from substance abuse and related disorders. The

 14  4    The bill requires each professional licensing board
 14  5 designated in Code section 147.13 to consider the adoption
 14  6 of a program modeled after the Iowa nurse assistance program
 14  7 and the Iowa physician health program for the identification
 14  8 and treatment of licensees who may be at risk for license
 14  9 discipline due to a substance use disorder.
 14 10    The bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse
 14 11 prevention and treatment fund to the department of public
 14 12 health for contracting with the Iowa health care collaborative

 14 28 state university of Iowa for the nonnarcotic treatment of pain.
 14 29    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 14 30 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 14 31 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 14 32 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 14 33 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 14 34 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 14 35 mandate included in the bill.

 13 33 department of human services, to make recommendations to the
 13 34 governor and the general assembly regarding the establishment
 13 35 of recovery high schools for the education of students
 14  1 recovering from substance abuse and related disorders. The
 14  2 bill requires the department of education to submit its

 14  6 of a program modeled after the Iowa nurse assistance program
 14  7 and the Iowa physician health program for the identification
 14  8 and treatment of licensees who may be at risk for license
 14  9 discipline due to a substance use disorder.
 14 10    The bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse
 14 11 prevention and treatment fund to the department of public
 14 12 health for contracting with the Iowa health care collaborative
 14 13 to develop and pilot protocols for the treatment of emergency

 14 19 substance use disorder treatment for 29 days or more. The
 14 20 bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse prevention and
 14 21 treatment fund to the state board of regents for FY 2018=2019

 14 28 state university of Iowa for the nonnarcotic treatment of pain.
 14 29    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 14 30 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 14 31 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 14 32 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 14 33 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 14 34 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 14 35 mandate included in the bill.

 11 24    The bill requires each county board of health, in
 11 25 cooperation with the relevant mental health and disability
 11 26 services region created in Code section 331.389 and substance
 11 27 abuse programs licensed pursuant to Code chapter 125, to

 13 13 to create a model benefit plan designed to incentivize or
 13 14 otherwise promote the effective, evidence=based prescription
 13 15 and use of opioids to members receiving benefits through state
 13 16 plans, document the current use of benefits for substance
 13 17 use disorders, identify gaps or unnecessary restrictions in
 13 18 coverage, and expand access to evidence=based treatments and

 14  7 and the Iowa physician health program for the identification
 14  8 and treatment of licensees who may be at risk for license
 14  9 discipline due to a substance use disorder.
 14 10    The bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse
 14 11 prevention and treatment fund to the department of public
 14 12 health for contracting with the Iowa health care collaborative
 14 13 to develop and pilot protocols for the treatment of emergency

 14 29    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 14 30 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 14 31 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 14 32 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 14 33 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 14 34 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 14 35 mandate included in the bill.

 10  8 opioids to a patient lasting longer than seven days and
 10  9 prior to issuing a second or subsequent prescription for an
 10 10 opioid to the patient. The bill requires the department of
 10 11 medicine to determine the form and content of the contract but
 10 12 requires that the contract be based on evidence regarding the
 10 13 responsible prescription of opioids.
 10 14    The bill establishes an opioid abuse prevention and
 10 15 treatment workgroup within the department of public health.

 11  4    The bill directs the workgroup to make recommendations to
 11  5 the department to expend moneys deposited in the opioid abuse
 11  6 prevention and treatment fund to carry out the recommendations
 11  7 of the workgroup in accordance with criteria set forth in
 11  8 Code section 135.191. The bill also directs the workgroup to

 11 16 treatments for substance use disorder treatments are covered
 11 17 by the authorization and payment policies of all public and

 11 21 addiction treatment, overdose, and overdose death surveillance
 11 22 metrics, standards, and requirements for data collected through
 11 23 county boards of health.
 11 24    The bill requires each county board of health, in
 11 25 cooperation with the relevant mental health and disability
 11 26 services region created in Code section 331.389 and substance
 11 27 abuse programs licensed pursuant to Code chapter 125, to
 11 28 include information regarding opioid abuse and substance use
 11 29 disorder treatment in each community health needs assessment,
 11 30 as well as in each health improvement plan when the county
 11 31 board of health deems it appropriate.
 11 32    The bill directs the board of pharmacy to adopt rules

 12 17    The bill requires the director of revenue to administer
 12 18 the excise tax as nearly as possible in conjunction with the
 12 19 administration of the state sales and use tax laws, and, to
 12 20 that end, the bill incorporates by reference several Code
 12 21 sections that relate to general tax administration and the
 12 22 sales and use tax laws.
 12 23    The bill requires excise tax revenues collected pursuant to

 13 10    The bill also directs the department of administrative
 13 11 services, in cooperation with any health plans or health
 13 12 plan administrators of benefits extended to state employees,
 13 13 to create a model benefit plan designed to incentivize or
 13 14 otherwise promote the effective, evidence=based prescription
 13 15 and use of opioids to members receiving benefits through state
 13 16 plans, document the current use of benefits for substance
 13 17 use disorders, identify gaps or unnecessary restrictions in
 13 18 coverage, and expand access to evidence=based treatments and
 13 19 therapies, including nonpharmacological treatments.
 13 20    The bill directs the department of human services and the

 13 30 waiver if necessary.
 13 31    The bill directs the department of education, in
 13 32 collaboration with the department of public health and the
 13 33 department of human services, to make recommendations to the
 13 34 governor and the general assembly regarding the establishment
 13 35 of recovery high schools for the education of students
 14  1 recovering from substance abuse and related disorders. The
 14  2 bill requires the department of education to submit its
 14  3 recommendations by November 1, 2018.
 14  4    The bill requires each professional licensing board
 14  5 designated in Code section 147.13 to consider the adoption
 14  6 of a program modeled after the Iowa nurse assistance program
 14  7 and the Iowa physician health program for the identification
 14  8 and treatment of licensees who may be at risk for license
 14  9 discipline due to a substance use disorder.
 14 10    The bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse
 14 11 prevention and treatment fund to the department of public
 14 12 health for contracting with the Iowa health care collaborative
 14 13 to develop and pilot protocols for the treatment of emergency
 14 14 room patients experiencing opioid or heroin overdoses

 14 17 sources and to support psychiatric residency programs at
 14 18 behavioral health treatment facilities offering residential
 14 19 substance use disorder treatment for 29 days or more. The
 14 20 bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse prevention and
 14 21 treatment fund to the state board of regents for FY 2018=2019
 14 22 for the funding of research conducted at the college of public

 14 28 state university of Iowa for the nonnarcotic treatment of pain.
 14 29    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 14 30 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 14 31 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 14 32 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 14 33 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 14 34 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 14 35 mandate included in the bill.

  9 33    This bill relates to the treatment of substance use disorder
  9 34 prevention and treatment, including creating an excise tax on
  9 35 the gross receipts of certain controlled substances sold at
 10  1 wholesale and an opioid abuse prevention and treatment fund,
 10  2 makes appropriations, and provides penalties.
 10  3    The bill directs the board of medicine to adopt rules
 10  4 requiring practitioners to present, and practitioners
 10  5 and patients to sign, a contract regarding the risks and
 10  6 responsibilities associated with opioid use prior to a
 10  7 practitioner's prescription of a course of treatment including
 10  8 opioids to a patient lasting longer than seven days and
 10  9 prior to issuing a second or subsequent prescription for an
 10 10 opioid to the patient. The bill requires the department of
 10 11 medicine to determine the form and content of the contract but
 10 12 requires that the contract be based on evidence regarding the
 10 13 responsible prescription of opioids.
 10 14    The bill establishes an opioid abuse prevention and
 10 15 treatment workgroup within the department of public health.
 10 16 Under the bill, the membership of the workgroup includes one
 10 17 physician, one pharmacist, one social worker, one advanced
 10 18 registered nurse practitioner, one representative of a county
 10 19 board of health, one representative of a substance abuse
 10 20 treatment program licensed under Code chapter 125, one person
 10 21 who has been treated for and has recovered from opioid abuse,
 10 22 and two persons who are not licensed to practice medicine,
 10 23 pharmacy, social work, or nursing who shall represent the
 10 24 general public.
 10 25    Under the bill, the workgroup is required to promote
 10 26 meetings and programs for the discussion of methods to reduce
 10 27 opioid abuse and disseminate information in cooperation

 10 30 care, treatment, and rehabilitation of persons affected by
 10 31 opioid abuse. The bill also requires the workgroup to study
 10 32 and review current prevention, evaluation, care, treatment,
 10 33 and rehabilitation programs and strategies and recommend
 10 34 appropriate preparation, training, retraining, and distribution

 11  2 licensed in accordance with the administrative rules of the
 11  3 department.
 11  4    The bill directs the workgroup to make recommendations to
 11  5 the department to expend moneys deposited in the opioid abuse
 11  6 prevention and treatment fund to carry out the recommendations
 11  7 of the workgroup in accordance with criteria set forth in
 11  8 Code section 135.191. The bill also directs the workgroup to
 11  9 make recommendations to the state board of health to approve

 11 11 the workgroup's recommendations.
 11 12    The bill provides that it is the public policy of the
 11 13 state of Iowa to increase the percentage of people receiving
 11 14 treatment for substance use disorders from 10 percent to
 11 15 80 percent and to ensure that all effective evidence=based
 11 16 treatments for substance use disorder treatments are covered
 11 17 by the authorization and payment policies of all public and
 11 18 private payers. The bill directs the department of public
 11 19 health, in consultation with the Iowa poison control center
 11 20 and the Iowa health care collaborative, to develop addiction,
 11 21 addiction treatment, overdose, and overdose death surveillance
 11 22 metrics, standards, and requirements for data collected through
 11 23 county boards of health.
 11 24    The bill requires each county board of health, in
 11 25 cooperation with the relevant mental health and disability
 11 26 services region created in Code section 331.389 and substance
 11 27 abuse programs licensed pursuant to Code chapter 125, to
 11 28 include information regarding opioid abuse and substance use
 11 29 disorder treatment in each community health needs assessment,
 11 30 as well as in each health improvement plan when the county
 11 31 board of health deems it appropriate.
 11 32    The bill directs the board of pharmacy to adopt rules
 11 33 requiring that packaging for certain opioids contain a label

 12 11    The bill imposes an excise tax of 5 percent on the gross
 12 12 receipts of schedule II controlled substances sold at wholesale
 12 13 to practitioners in the state. The tax shall be collected and
 12 14 paid over to the department of revenue by the wholesaler. The
 12 15 bill contains definitions for "gross receipts", "practitioner",
 12 16 "schedule II controlled substance", and "wholesaler".
 12 17    The bill requires the director of revenue to administer
 12 18 the excise tax as nearly as possible in conjunction with the
 12 19 administration of the state sales and use tax laws, and, to
 12 20 that end, the bill incorporates by reference several Code
 12 21 sections that relate to general tax administration and the
 12 22 sales and use tax laws.
 12 23    The bill requires excise tax revenues collected pursuant to
 12 24 the bill to be deposited in the general fund of the state, then

 12 29 for opioid use disorders and to assist opioid abuse prevention
 12 30 and treatment programs in the state, including but not limited

 12 32 deposited in the fund from the revenues of the excise tax, and
 12 33 any other moneys obtained by the department for placement in

 13  7 utilization and expenditures associated with such benefit
 13  8 plans. The bill requires this report to be submitted to the
 13  9 general assembly by March 1, 2019.
 13 10    The bill also directs the department of administrative
 13 11 services, in cooperation with any health plans or health
 13 12 plan administrators of benefits extended to state employees,
 13 13 to create a model benefit plan designed to incentivize or
 13 14 otherwise promote the effective, evidence=based prescription
 13 15 and use of opioids to members receiving benefits through state
 13 16 plans, document the current use of benefits for substance
 13 17 use disorders, identify gaps or unnecessary restrictions in
 13 18 coverage, and expand access to evidence=based treatments and
 13 19 therapies, including nonpharmacological treatments.
 13 20    The bill directs the department of human services and the
 13 21 Iowa Medicaid enterprise, in cooperation with managed care
 13 22 organizations, to design benefit plans to incentivize or

 13 28 to evidence=based treatment and therapies, including
 13 29 nonpharmacological treatments, by application for a Medicaid
 13 30 waiver if necessary.
 13 31    The bill directs the department of education, in
 13 32 collaboration with the department of public health and the
 13 33 department of human services, to make recommendations to the
 13 34 governor and the general assembly regarding the establishment
 13 35 of recovery high schools for the education of students
 14  1 recovering from substance abuse and related disorders. The
 14  2 bill requires the department of education to submit its
 14  3 recommendations by November 1, 2018.
 14  4    The bill requires each professional licensing board
 14  5 designated in Code section 147.13 to consider the adoption
 14  6 of a program modeled after the Iowa nurse assistance program
 14  7 and the Iowa physician health program for the identification
 14  8 and treatment of licensees who may be at risk for license
 14  9 discipline due to a substance use disorder.
 14 10    The bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse
 14 11 prevention and treatment fund to the department of public
 14 12 health for contracting with the Iowa health care collaborative
 14 13 to develop and pilot protocols for the treatment of emergency
 14 14 room patients experiencing opioid or heroin overdoses
 14 15 contingent on the Iowa health care collaborative receiving
 14 16 dollar=for=dollar matching funding from private or public
 14 17 sources and to support psychiatric residency programs at
 14 18 behavioral health treatment facilities offering residential
 14 19 substance use disorder treatment for 29 days or more. The
 14 20 bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse prevention and
 14 21 treatment fund to the state board of regents for FY 2018=2019
 14 22 for the funding of research conducted at the college of public
 14 23 health at the state university of Iowa for medication=assisted
 14 24 treatment of substance use disorders to identify variability
 14 25 in outcomes, demonstrate efficacy of treatment, and refine
 14 26 evidence=based protocols, and for the funding of research and
 14 27 education conducted at the Carver college of medicine at the
 14 28 state university of Iowa for the nonnarcotic treatment of pain.
 14 29    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 14 30 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 14 31 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 14 32 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 14 33 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 14 34 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 14 35 mandate included in the bill.

  9 33    This bill relates to the treatment of substance use disorder
  9 34 prevention and treatment, including creating an excise tax on
  9 35 the gross receipts of certain controlled substances sold at

 10  2 makes appropriations, and provides penalties.
 10  3    The bill directs the board of medicine to adopt rules
 10  4 requiring practitioners to present, and practitioners
 10  5 and patients to sign, a contract regarding the risks and
 10  6 responsibilities associated with opioid use prior to a
 10  7 practitioner's prescription of a course of treatment including
 10  8 opioids to a patient lasting longer than seven days and
 10  9 prior to issuing a second or subsequent prescription for an
 10 10 opioid to the patient. The bill requires the department of
 10 11 medicine to determine the form and content of the contract but
 10 12 requires that the contract be based on evidence regarding the
 10 13 responsible prescription of opioids.
 10 14    The bill establishes an opioid abuse prevention and
 10 15 treatment workgroup within the department of public health.
 10 16 Under the bill, the membership of the workgroup includes one

 11 16 treatments for substance use disorder treatments are covered
 11 17 by the authorization and payment policies of all public and
 11 18 private payers. The bill directs the department of public
 11 19 health, in consultation with the Iowa poison control center

 14  9 discipline due to a substance use disorder.
 14 10    The bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse
 14 11 prevention and treatment fund to the department of public
 14 12 health for contracting with the Iowa health care collaborative

  9 33    This bill relates to the treatment of substance use disorder
  9 34 prevention and treatment, including creating an excise tax on
  9 35 the gross receipts of certain controlled substances sold at
 10  1 wholesale and an opioid abuse prevention and treatment fund,
 10  2 makes appropriations, and provides penalties.
 10  3    The bill directs the board of medicine to adopt rules
 10  4 requiring practitioners to present, and practitioners
 10  5 and patients to sign, a contract regarding the risks and

 10  8 opioids to a patient lasting longer than seven days and
 10  9 prior to issuing a second or subsequent prescription for an
 10 10 opioid to the patient. The bill requires the department of
 10 11 medicine to determine the form and content of the contract but
 10 12 requires that the contract be based on evidence regarding the
 10 13 responsible prescription of opioids.
 10 14    The bill establishes an opioid abuse prevention and
 10 15 treatment workgroup within the department of public health.
 10 16 Under the bill, the membership of the workgroup includes one
 10 17 physician, one pharmacist, one social worker, one advanced
 10 18 registered nurse practitioner, one representative of a county

 10 30 care, treatment, and rehabilitation of persons affected by
 10 31 opioid abuse. The bill also requires the workgroup to study
 10 32 and review current prevention, evaluation, care, treatment,
 10 33 and rehabilitation programs and strategies and recommend

 11 16 treatments for substance use disorder treatments are covered
 11 17 by the authorization and payment policies of all public and

 10  8 opioids to a patient lasting longer than seven days and
 10  9 prior to issuing a second or subsequent prescription for an
 10 10 opioid to the patient. The bill requires the department of
 10 11 medicine to determine the form and content of the contract but
 10 12 requires that the contract be based on evidence regarding the
 10 13 responsible prescription of opioids.
 10 14    The bill establishes an opioid abuse prevention and
 10 15 treatment workgroup within the department of public health.
 10 16 Under the bill, the membership of the workgroup includes one

 10 30 care, treatment, and rehabilitation of persons affected by
 10 31 opioid abuse. The bill also requires the workgroup to study
 10 32 and review current prevention, evaluation, care, treatment,
 10 33 and rehabilitation programs and strategies and recommend
 10 34 appropriate preparation, training, retraining, and distribution

 11 16 treatments for substance use disorder treatments are covered
 11 17 by the authorization and payment policies of all public and
 11 18 private payers. The bill directs the department of public
 11 19 health, in consultation with the Iowa poison control center

 11 24    The bill requires each county board of health, in
 11 25 cooperation with the relevant mental health and disability
 11 26 services region created in Code section 331.389 and substance
 11 27 abuse programs licensed pursuant to Code chapter 125, to
 11 28 include information regarding opioid abuse and substance use

  9 31 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  9 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 33    This bill relates to the treatment of substance use disorder
  9 34 prevention and treatment, including creating an excise tax on
  9 35 the gross receipts of certain controlled substances sold at
 10  1 wholesale and an opioid abuse prevention and treatment fund,
 10  2 makes appropriations, and provides penalties.
 10  3    The bill directs the board of medicine to adopt rules
 10  4 requiring practitioners to present, and practitioners
 10  5 and patients to sign, a contract regarding the risks and
 10  6 responsibilities associated with opioid use prior to a
 10  7 practitioner's prescription of a course of treatment including
 10  8 opioids to a patient lasting longer than seven days and
 10  9 prior to issuing a second or subsequent prescription for an
 10 10 opioid to the patient. The bill requires the department of
 10 11 medicine to determine the form and content of the contract but
 10 12 requires that the contract be based on evidence regarding the
 10 13 responsible prescription of opioids.
 10 14    The bill establishes an opioid abuse prevention and
 10 15 treatment workgroup within the department of public health.
 10 16 Under the bill, the membership of the workgroup includes one
 10 17 physician, one pharmacist, one social worker, one advanced
 10 18 registered nurse practitioner, one representative of a county
 10 19 board of health, one representative of a substance abuse
 10 20 treatment program licensed under Code chapter 125, one person
 10 21 who has been treated for and has recovered from opioid abuse,
 10 22 and two persons who are not licensed to practice medicine,
 10 23 pharmacy, social work, or nursing who shall represent the
 10 24 general public.
 10 25    Under the bill, the workgroup is required to promote
 10 26 meetings and programs for the discussion of methods to reduce
 10 27 opioid abuse and disseminate information in cooperation

 10 30 care, treatment, and rehabilitation of persons affected by
 10 31 opioid abuse. The bill also requires the workgroup to study
 10 32 and review current prevention, evaluation, care, treatment,
 10 33 and rehabilitation programs and strategies and recommend
 10 34 appropriate preparation, training, retraining, and distribution
 10 35 of personnel and resources in the provision of services to
 11  1 persons with opioid abuse issues through treatment programs
 11  2 licensed in accordance with the administrative rules of the
 11  3 department.
 11  4    The bill directs the workgroup to make recommendations to
 11  5 the department to expend moneys deposited in the opioid abuse
 11  6 prevention and treatment fund to carry out the recommendations
 11  7 of the workgroup in accordance with criteria set forth in
 11  8 Code section 135.191. The bill also directs the workgroup to
 11  9 make recommendations to the state board of health to approve
 11 10 administrative rules for adoption by the department relating to
 11 11 the workgroup's recommendations.
 11 12    The bill provides that it is the public policy of the
 11 13 state of Iowa to increase the percentage of people receiving
 11 14 treatment for substance use disorders from 10 percent to
 11 15 80 percent and to ensure that all effective evidence=based
 11 16 treatments for substance use disorder treatments are covered
 11 17 by the authorization and payment policies of all public and
 11 18 private payers. The bill directs the department of public
 11 19 health, in consultation with the Iowa poison control center
 11 20 and the Iowa health care collaborative, to develop addiction,
 11 21 addiction treatment, overdose, and overdose death surveillance
 11 22 metrics, standards, and requirements for data collected through
 11 23 county boards of health.
 11 24    The bill requires each county board of health, in
 11 25 cooperation with the relevant mental health and disability
 11 26 services region created in Code section 331.389 and substance
 11 27 abuse programs licensed pursuant to Code chapter 125, to
 11 28 include information regarding opioid abuse and substance use
 11 29 disorder treatment in each community health needs assessment,
 11 30 as well as in each health improvement plan when the county
 11 31 board of health deems it appropriate.
 11 32    The bill directs the board of pharmacy to adopt rules
 11 33 requiring that packaging for certain opioids contain a label
 11 34 including information regarding the dangers of opioid use and

 12  9 disorder under the direction of a licensed health care provider
 12 10 continue to receive such treatment while confined in jail.
 12 11    The bill imposes an excise tax of 5 percent on the gross
 12 12 receipts of schedule II controlled substances sold at wholesale
 12 13 to practitioners in the state. The tax shall be collected and
 12 14 paid over to the department of revenue by the wholesaler. The
 12 15 bill contains definitions for "gross receipts", "practitioner",
 12 16 "schedule II controlled substance", and "wholesaler".
 12 17    The bill requires the director of revenue to administer
 12 18 the excise tax as nearly as possible in conjunction with the
 12 19 administration of the state sales and use tax laws, and, to
 12 20 that end, the bill incorporates by reference several Code
 12 21 sections that relate to general tax administration and the
 12 22 sales and use tax laws.
 12 23    The bill requires excise tax revenues collected pursuant to
 12 24 the bill to be deposited in the general fund of the state, then
 12 25 transferred to the opioid abuse prevention and treatment fund
 12 26 created in the bill. The fund is created in the state treasury
 12 27 under the control of the department of public health. The fund
 12 28 is established to expand treatment for and access to treatment
 12 29 for opioid use disorders and to assist opioid abuse prevention
 12 30 and treatment programs in the state, including but not limited
 12 31 to programs described in the bill. The fund consists of moneys
 12 32 deposited in the fund from the revenues of the excise tax, and
 12 33 any other moneys obtained by the department for placement in
 12 34 the fund. Moneys in the fund are not subject to Code section

 13  1 on moneys in the fund shall be credited to the fund.
 13  2    The bill directs the insurance division of the department
 13  3 of commerce to prepare a comprehensive report on insurance

 13  5 treatment of substance use disorders by commercial insurance
 13  6 companies and self=funded plans, as well as data on current
 13  7 utilization and expenditures associated with such benefit
 13  8 plans. The bill requires this report to be submitted to the
 13  9 general assembly by March 1, 2019.
 13 10    The bill also directs the department of administrative
 13 11 services, in cooperation with any health plans or health
 13 12 plan administrators of benefits extended to state employees,
 13 13 to create a model benefit plan designed to incentivize or
 13 14 otherwise promote the effective, evidence=based prescription
 13 15 and use of opioids to members receiving benefits through state
 13 16 plans, document the current use of benefits for substance
 13 17 use disorders, identify gaps or unnecessary restrictions in
 13 18 coverage, and expand access to evidence=based treatments and
 13 19 therapies, including nonpharmacological treatments.
 13 20    The bill directs the department of human services and the
 13 21 Iowa Medicaid enterprise, in cooperation with managed care
 13 22 organizations, to design benefit plans to incentivize or
 13 23 otherwise promote the effective, evidence=based prescription
 13 24 and use of opioids to members receiving benefits through
 13 25 managed care organizations, document the current use of
 13 26 benefits for substance use disorders, identify gaps or
 13 27 unnecessary restrictions in coverage, and expand access
 13 28 to evidence=based treatment and therapies, including
 13 29 nonpharmacological treatments, by application for a Medicaid
 13 30 waiver if necessary.
 13 31    The bill directs the department of education, in
 13 32 collaboration with the department of public health and the
 13 33 department of human services, to make recommendations to the
 13 34 governor and the general assembly regarding the establishment
 13 35 of recovery high schools for the education of students
 14  1 recovering from substance abuse and related disorders. The
 14  2 bill requires the department of education to submit its
 14  3 recommendations by November 1, 2018.
 14  4    The bill requires each professional licensing board
 14  5 designated in Code section 147.13 to consider the adoption
 14  6 of a program modeled after the Iowa nurse assistance program
 14  7 and the Iowa physician health program for the identification
 14  8 and treatment of licensees who may be at risk for license
 14  9 discipline due to a substance use disorder.
 14 10    The bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse
 14 11 prevention and treatment fund to the department of public
 14 12 health for contracting with the Iowa health care collaborative
 14 13 to develop and pilot protocols for the treatment of emergency
 14 14 room patients experiencing opioid or heroin overdoses
 14 15 contingent on the Iowa health care collaborative receiving
 14 16 dollar=for=dollar matching funding from private or public
 14 17 sources and to support psychiatric residency programs at
 14 18 behavioral health treatment facilities offering residential
 14 19 substance use disorder treatment for 29 days or more. The
 14 20 bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse prevention and
 14 21 treatment fund to the state board of regents for FY 2018=2019
 14 22 for the funding of research conducted at the college of public
 14 23 health at the state university of Iowa for medication=assisted
 14 24 treatment of substance use disorders to identify variability
 14 25 in outcomes, demonstrate efficacy of treatment, and refine
 14 26 evidence=based protocols, and for the funding of research and
 14 27 education conducted at the Carver college of medicine at the
 14 28 state university of Iowa for the nonnarcotic treatment of pain.
 14 29    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 14 30 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 14 31 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 14 32 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 14 33 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 14 34 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 14 35 mandate included in the bill.

  9 32 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  9 33    This bill relates to the treatment of substance use disorder
  9 34 prevention and treatment, including creating an excise tax on
  9 35 the gross receipts of certain controlled substances sold at

 10  2 makes appropriations, and provides penalties.
 10  3    The bill directs the board of medicine to adopt rules
 10  4 requiring practitioners to present, and practitioners
 10  5 and patients to sign, a contract regarding the risks and
 10  6 responsibilities associated with opioid use prior to a
 10  7 practitioner's prescription of a course of treatment including
 10  8 opioids to a patient lasting longer than seven days and
 10  9 prior to issuing a second or subsequent prescription for an
 10 10 opioid to the patient. The bill requires the department of
 10 11 medicine to determine the form and content of the contract but
 10 12 requires that the contract be based on evidence regarding the
 10 13 responsible prescription of opioids.
 10 14    The bill establishes an opioid abuse prevention and
 10 15 treatment workgroup within the department of public health.
 10 16 Under the bill, the membership of the workgroup includes one
 10 17 physician, one pharmacist, one social worker, one advanced
 10 18 registered nurse practitioner, one representative of a county
 10 19 board of health, one representative of a substance abuse
 10 20 treatment program licensed under Code chapter 125, one person
 10 21 who has been treated for and has recovered from opioid abuse,
 10 22 and two persons who are not licensed to practice medicine,
 10 23 pharmacy, social work, or nursing who shall represent the
 10 24 general public.
 10 25    Under the bill, the workgroup is required to promote
 10 26 meetings and programs for the discussion of methods to reduce
 10 27 opioid abuse and disseminate information in cooperation

 10 30 care, treatment, and rehabilitation of persons affected by
 10 31 opioid abuse. The bill also requires the workgroup to study
 10 32 and review current prevention, evaluation, care, treatment,
 10 33 and rehabilitation programs and strategies and recommend
 10 34 appropriate preparation, training, retraining, and distribution

 11  3 department.
 11  4    The bill directs the workgroup to make recommendations to
 11  5 the department to expend moneys deposited in the opioid abuse
 11  6 prevention and treatment fund to carry out the recommendations
 11  7 of the workgroup in accordance with criteria set forth in
 11  8 Code section 135.191. The bill also directs the workgroup to

 11 15 80 percent and to ensure that all effective evidence=based
 11 16 treatments for substance use disorder treatments are covered
 11 17 by the authorization and payment policies of all public and
 11 18 private payers. The bill directs the department of public
 11 19 health, in consultation with the Iowa poison control center
 11 20 and the Iowa health care collaborative, to develop addiction,
 11 21 addiction treatment, overdose, and overdose death surveillance
 11 22 metrics, standards, and requirements for data collected through
 11 23 county boards of health.
 11 24    The bill requires each county board of health, in
 11 25 cooperation with the relevant mental health and disability
 11 26 services region created in Code section 331.389 and substance
 11 27 abuse programs licensed pursuant to Code chapter 125, to
 11 28 include information regarding opioid abuse and substance use
 11 29 disorder treatment in each community health needs assessment,
 11 30 as well as in each health improvement plan when the county
 11 31 board of health deems it appropriate.
 11 32    The bill directs the board of pharmacy to adopt rules
 11 33 requiring that packaging for certain opioids contain a label

 12 11    The bill imposes an excise tax of 5 percent on the gross
 12 12 receipts of schedule II controlled substances sold at wholesale
 12 13 to practitioners in the state. The tax shall be collected and
 12 14 paid over to the department of revenue by the wholesaler. The
 12 15 bill contains definitions for "gross receipts", "practitioner",
 12 16 "schedule II controlled substance", and "wholesaler".
 12 17    The bill requires the director of revenue to administer
 12 18 the excise tax as nearly as possible in conjunction with the
 12 19 administration of the state sales and use tax laws, and, to
 12 20 that end, the bill incorporates by reference several Code
 12 21 sections that relate to general tax administration and the
 12 22 sales and use tax laws.
 12 23    The bill requires excise tax revenues collected pursuant to

 13  7 utilization and expenditures associated with such benefit
 13  8 plans. The bill requires this report to be submitted to the

 13 10    The bill also directs the department of administrative
 13 11 services, in cooperation with any health plans or health
 13 12 plan administrators of benefits extended to state employees,
 13 13 to create a model benefit plan designed to incentivize or
 13 14 otherwise promote the effective, evidence=based prescription
 13 15 and use of opioids to members receiving benefits through state
 13 16 plans, document the current use of benefits for substance
 13 17 use disorders, identify gaps or unnecessary restrictions in
 13 18 coverage, and expand access to evidence=based treatments and
 13 19 therapies, including nonpharmacological treatments.
 13 20    The bill directs the department of human services and the
 13 21 Iowa Medicaid enterprise, in cooperation with managed care

 13 31    The bill directs the department of education, in
 13 32 collaboration with the department of public health and the
 13 33 department of human services, to make recommendations to the
 13 34 governor and the general assembly regarding the establishment
 13 35 of recovery high schools for the education of students
 14  1 recovering from substance abuse and related disorders. The
 14  2 bill requires the department of education to submit its
 14  3 recommendations by November 1, 2018.
 14  4    The bill requires each professional licensing board
 14  5 designated in Code section 147.13 to consider the adoption
 14  6 of a program modeled after the Iowa nurse assistance program
 14  7 and the Iowa physician health program for the identification
 14  8 and treatment of licensees who may be at risk for license
 14  9 discipline due to a substance use disorder.
 14 10    The bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse
 14 11 prevention and treatment fund to the department of public
 14 12 health for contracting with the Iowa health care collaborative
 14 13 to develop and pilot protocols for the treatment of emergency
 14 14 room patients experiencing opioid or heroin overdoses

 14 17 sources and to support psychiatric residency programs at
 14 18 behavioral health treatment facilities offering residential
 14 19 substance use disorder treatment for 29 days or more. The
 14 20 bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse prevention and
 14 21 treatment fund to the state board of regents for FY 2018=2019
 14 22 for the funding of research conducted at the college of public
 14 23 health at the state university of Iowa for medication=assisted

 14 28 state university of Iowa for the nonnarcotic treatment of pain.
 14 29    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 14 30 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 14 31 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from
 14 32 complying with a state mandate if funding for the cost of
 14 33 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 14 34 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 14 35 mandate included in the bill.

 11 26 services region created in Code section 331.389 and substance
 11 27 abuse programs licensed pursuant to Code chapter 125, to

 14 29    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 14 30 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 14 31 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

 14 33 the state mandate is not provided or specified.  Therefore,
 14 34 political subdivisions are required to comply with any state
 14 35 mandate included in the bill.

 11 24    The bill requires each county board of health, in
 11 25 cooperation with the relevant mental health and disability
 11 26 services region created in Code section 331.389 and substance
 11 27 abuse programs licensed pursuant to Code chapter 125, to

 14  9 discipline due to a substance use disorder.
 14 10    The bill appropriates moneys from the opioid abuse
 14 11 prevention and treatment fund to the department of public
 14 12 health for contracting with the Iowa health care collaborative
 14 13 to develop and pilot protocols for the treatment of emergency

 14 29    The bill may include a state mandate as defined in Code
 14 30 section 25B.3.  The bill makes inapplicable Code section 25B.2,
 14 31 subsection 3, which would relieve a political subdivision from

 11 26 services region created in Code section 331.389 and substance
 11 27 abuse programs licensed pursuant to Code chapter 125, to
