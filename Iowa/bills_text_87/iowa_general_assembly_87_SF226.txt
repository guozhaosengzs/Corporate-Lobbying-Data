  7  4    COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THIS FORM
  7  5    What does the Transfer on Death (TOD) deed do?
  7  6    When you die, this deed transfers the described property,
  7  7 subject to any liens or mortgages (or other encumbrances) on
  7  8 the property at your death. Probate is not required. The TOD
  7  9 deed has no effect until you die. You can revoke it at any
  7 10 time. You are also free to transfer the property to someone
  7 11 else during your lifetime. If you do not own any interest in
  7 12 the property when you die, this deed will have no effect.
  7 13    How do I make a TOD deed?
  7 14    Complete this form. Have it acknowledged before a
  7 15 notary public or other individual authorized by law to take
  7 16 acknowledgments. Record the form in each county where any part
  7 17 of the property is located. The form has no effect unless it is
  7 18 acknowledged and recorded before your death.
  7 19    Is the legal description of the property necessary?
  7 20    Yes.
  7 21    How do I find the legal description of the property?
  7 22    This information may be on the deed you received when you
  7 23 became an owner of the property. This information may also be
  7 24 available in the office of the county recorder for the county
  7 25 where the property is located. If you are not absolutely sure,
  7 26 consult a lawyer.
  7 27    Can I change my mind before I record the TOD deed?
  7 28    Yes. If you have not yet recorded the deed and want to
  7 29 change your mind, simply tear up or otherwise destroy the deed.
  7 30    How do I record the TOD deed?
  7 31    Take the completed and acknowledged form to the office
  7 32 of the county recorder of the county where the property is
  7 33 located. Follow the instructions given by the county recorder
  7 34 to make the form part of the official property records. If the
  7 35 property is in more than one county, you should record the deed
  8  1 in each county.
  8  2    Can I later revoke the TOD deed if I change my mind?
  8  3    Yes. You can revoke the TOD deed. No one, including the
  8  4 beneficiaries, can prevent you from revoking the deed.
  8  5    How do I revoke the TOD deed after it is recorded?
  8  6    There are three ways to revoke a recorded TOD deed: [1]
  8  7 Complete and acknowledge a revocation form, and record it in
  8  8 each county where the property is located. [2] Complete and
  8  9 acknowledge a new TOD deed that disposes of the same property,
  8 10 and record it in each county where the property is located.
  8 11 [3] Transfer the property to someone else during your lifetime
  8 12 by a recorded deed that expressly revokes the TOD deed. You
  8 13 may not revoke the TOD deed by will.
  8 14    I am being pressured to complete this form. What should I
  8 15 do?
  8 16    Do not complete this form under pressure. Seek help from a
  8 17 trusted family member, friend, or lawyer.
  8 18    Do I need to tell the beneficiaries about the TOD deed?
  8 19    No, but it is recommended.  Secrecy can cause later
  8 20 complications and might make it easier for others to commit
  8 21 fraud.
  8 22    I have other questions about this form. What should I do?
  8 23    This form is designed to fit some but not all situations.
  8 24 If you have other questions, you are encouraged to consult a
  8 25 lawyer.

  7 20    Yes.
  7 21    How do I find the legal description of the property?
  7 22    This information may be on the deed you received when you
  7 23 became an owner of the property. This information may also be
  7 24 available in the office of the county recorder for the county
  7 25 where the property is located. If you are not absolutely sure,

  7 31    Take the completed and acknowledged form to the office
  7 32 of the county recorder of the county where the property is
  7 33 located. Follow the instructions given by the county recorder

  7 13    How do I make a TOD deed?

  7 20    Yes.
  7 21    How do I find the legal description of the property?
  7 22    This information may be on the deed you received when you
  7 23 became an owner of the property. This information may also be
  7 24 available in the office of the county recorder for the county
  7 25 where the property is located. If you are not absolutely sure,
  7 26 consult a lawyer.
  7 27    Can I change my mind before I record the TOD deed?

  7 31    Take the completed and acknowledged form to the office
  7 32 of the county recorder of the county where the property is
  7 33 located. Follow the instructions given by the county recorder

  7 16 acknowledgments. Record the form in each county where any part
  7 17 of the property is located. The form has no effect unless it is
  7 18 acknowledged and recorded before your death.
  7 19    Is the legal description of the property necessary?
  7 20    Yes.
  7 21    How do I find the legal description of the property?
  7 22    This information may be on the deed you received when you
  7 23 became an owner of the property. This information may also be
  7 24 available in the office of the county recorder for the county
  7 25 where the property is located. If you are not absolutely sure,
  7 26 consult a lawyer.
  7 27    Can I change my mind before I record the TOD deed?
  7 28    Yes. If you have not yet recorded the deed and want to
  7 29 change your mind, simply tear up or otherwise destroy the deed.
  7 30    How do I record the TOD deed?
  7 31    Take the completed and acknowledged form to the office
  7 32 of the county recorder of the county where the property is
  7 33 located. Follow the instructions given by the county recorder
  7 34 to make the form part of the official property records. If the
  7 35 property is in more than one county, you should record the deed
  8  1 in each county.
  8  2    Can I later revoke the TOD deed if I change my mind?
  8  3    Yes. You can revoke the TOD deed. No one, including the
  8  4 beneficiaries, can prevent you from revoking the deed.
  8  5    How do I revoke the TOD deed after it is recorded?
  8  6    There are three ways to revoke a recorded TOD deed: [1]
  8  7 Complete and acknowledge a revocation form, and record it in
  8  8 each county where the property is located. [2] Complete and
  8  9 acknowledge a new TOD deed that disposes of the same property,
  8 10 and record it in each county where the property is located.
  8 11 [3] Transfer the property to someone else during your lifetime
  8 12 by a recorded deed that expressly revokes the TOD deed. You
  8 13 may not revoke the TOD deed by will.
  8 14    I am being pressured to complete this form. What should I
  8 15 do?

  8 17 trusted family member, friend, or lawyer.
  8 18    Do I need to tell the beneficiaries about the TOD deed?

  8 21 fraud.

  8  1 in each county.
  8  2    Can I later revoke the TOD deed if I change my mind?
  8  3    Yes. You can revoke the TOD deed. No one, including the
  8  4 beneficiaries, can prevent you from revoking the deed.
  8  5    How do I revoke the TOD deed after it is recorded?
  8  6    There are three ways to revoke a recorded TOD deed: [1]
  8  7 Complete and acknowledge a revocation form, and record it in
  8  8 each county where the property is located. [2] Complete and
  8  9 acknowledge a new TOD deed that disposes of the same property,
  8 10 and record it in each county where the property is located.
  8 11 [3] Transfer the property to someone else during your lifetime
  8 12 by a recorded deed that expressly revokes the TOD deed. You
  8 13 may not revoke the TOD deed by will.
  8 14    I am being pressured to complete this form. What should I
  8 15 do?
  8 16    Do not complete this form under pressure. Seek help from a
  8 17 trusted family member, friend, or lawyer.
  8 18    Do I need to tell the beneficiaries about the TOD deed?
  8 19    No, but it is recommended.  Secrecy can cause later
  8 20 complications and might make it easier for others to commit
  8 21 fraud.
  8 22    I have other questions about this form. What should I do?
  8 23    This form is designed to fit some but not all situations.
  8 24 If you have other questions, you are encouraged to consult a

  7  4    COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF THIS FORM
  7  5    What does the Transfer on Death (TOD) deed do?
  7  6    When you die, this deed transfers the described property,
  7  7 subject to any liens or mortgages (or other encumbrances) on
  7  8 the property at your death. Probate is not required. The TOD
  7  9 deed has no effect until you die. You can revoke it at any
  7 10 time. You are also free to transfer the property to someone
  7 11 else during your lifetime. If you do not own any interest in
  7 12 the property when you die, this deed will have no effect.
  7 13    How do I make a TOD deed?
  7 14    Complete this form. Have it acknowledged before a
  7 15 notary public or other individual authorized by law to take
  7 16 acknowledgments. Record the form in each county where any part
  7 17 of the property is located. The form has no effect unless it is
  7 18 acknowledged and recorded before your death.
  7 19    Is the legal description of the property necessary?
  7 20    Yes.
  7 21    How do I find the legal description of the property?
  7 22    This information may be on the deed you received when you
  7 23 became an owner of the property. This information may also be
  7 24 available in the office of the county recorder for the county
  7 25 where the property is located. If you are not absolutely sure,
  7 26 consult a lawyer.
  7 27    Can I change my mind before I record the TOD deed?
  7 28    Yes. If you have not yet recorded the deed and want to
  7 29 change your mind, simply tear up or otherwise destroy the deed.
  7 30    How do I record the TOD deed?
  7 31    Take the completed and acknowledged form to the office
  7 32 of the county recorder of the county where the property is
  7 33 located. Follow the instructions given by the county recorder
  7 34 to make the form part of the official property records. If the
  7 35 property is in more than one county, you should record the deed
  8  1 in each county.
  8  2    Can I later revoke the TOD deed if I change my mind?
  8  3    Yes. You can revoke the TOD deed. No one, including the
  8  4 beneficiaries, can prevent you from revoking the deed.
  8  5    How do I revoke the TOD deed after it is recorded?
  8  6    There are three ways to revoke a recorded TOD deed: [1]
  8  7 Complete and acknowledge a revocation form, and record it in
  8  8 each county where the property is located. [2] Complete and
  8  9 acknowledge a new TOD deed that disposes of the same property,
  8 10 and record it in each county where the property is located.
  8 11 [3] Transfer the property to someone else during your lifetime
  8 12 by a recorded deed that expressly revokes the TOD deed. You
  8 13 may not revoke the TOD deed by will.
  8 14    I am being pressured to complete this form. What should I
  8 15 do?
  8 16    Do not complete this form under pressure. Seek help from a
  8 17 trusted family member, friend, or lawyer.
  8 18    Do I need to tell the beneficiaries about the TOD deed?
  8 19    No, but it is recommended.  Secrecy can cause later
  8 20 complications and might make it easier for others to commit
  8 21 fraud.
  8 22    I have other questions about this form. What should I do?
  8 23    This form is designed to fit some but not all situations.
  8 24 If you have other questions, you are encouraged to consult a

  7  7 subject to any liens or mortgages (or other encumbrances) on
  7  8 the property at your death. Probate is not required. The TOD
  7  9 deed has no effect until you die. You can revoke it at any

  7 11 else during your lifetime. If you do not own any interest in
  7 12 the property when you die, this deed will have no effect.
  7 13    How do I make a TOD deed?

  7 19    Is the legal description of the property necessary?
  7 20    Yes.
  7 21    How do I find the legal description of the property?
  7 22    This information may be on the deed you received when you
  7 23 became an owner of the property. This information may also be
  7 24 available in the office of the county recorder for the county

  7 27    Can I change my mind before I record the TOD deed?

  7 29 change your mind, simply tear up or otherwise destroy the deed.
  7 30    How do I record the TOD deed?
  7 31    Take the completed and acknowledged form to the office
  7 32 of the county recorder of the county where the property is
  7 33 located. Follow the instructions given by the county recorder

 11 23 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
 11 24 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
 11 25    This bill provides that an individual may execute a transfer
 11 26 on death deed which transfers real property outside of probate
 11 27 to one or more beneficiaries effective at the transferor's
 11 28 death.
 11 29    To be valid, a transfer on death deed must contain the
 11 30 essential elements and formalities of a properly recordable
 11 31 inter vivos deed, state that the transfer to the designated
 11 32 beneficiary is to occur at the transferor's death, and be
 11 33 recorded before the transferor's death in the office of the
 11 34 county recorder.
 11 35    A transfer on death deed is revocable, even if the deed
 12  1 states that the deed is irrevocable. A transferor may revoke
 12  2 a transfer on death deed by acknowledging and recording an
 12  3 inconsistent transfer on death deed, or an instrument of
 12  4 revocation or inter vivos deed that expressly revokes the deed.
 12  5    A transfer on death dead is nontestamentary, and the
 12  6 capacity required to make or revoke a transfer on death deed is
 12  7 the same capacity required to make a will.
 12  8    A transfer on death deed is effective even if the beneficiary
 12  9 does not receive notice or delivery of the deed during the
 12 10 transferor's lifetime, and even if the transferor does not
 12 11 receive consideration for the deed.
 12 12    During the transferor's lifetime, a transfer on death deed
 12 13 does not affect the transferor's interest in the property,
 12 14 including the right to transfer or encumber the property, nor
 12 15 does the transfer on death deed create a legal or equitable
 12 16 interest in favor of the designated beneficiary or subject the
 12 17 property to claims of a creditor of the designated beneficiary.
 12 18 If the transferor transfers the property that is the subject
 12 19 of a transfer of death deed before the transferor's death, the
 12 20 transfer on death deed is of no effect at the death of the
 12 21 transferor.
 12 22    At the death of the transferor, subject to Code sections
 12 23 633.238 (elective share of surviving spouse), 633.523 through
 12 24 633.538 (uniform simultaneous death act), and 633.535 through
 12 25 633.537 (felonious death), the property is transferred to the
 12 26 designated beneficiary if the designated beneficiary is alive.
 12 27 If the designated beneficiary predeceases the transferor, the
 12 28 interest of the designated beneficiary lapses.
 12 29    Subject to Code section 558.41 (recording), a beneficiary
 12 30 who takes property under a transfer on death deed takes the
 12 31 property subject to all conveyances, encumbrances, assignments,
 12 32 contracts, mortgages, liens, and other interests to which the
 12 33 property is subject at the transferor's death.
 12 34    If the transferor owns the property as a joint tenant or as
 12 35 a tenant by the entirety, the transfer on death deed is only
 13  1 effective if the transferor is the last surviving joint tenant
 13  2 or tenant by the entirety.
 13  3    A beneficiary may disclaim all or part of the beneficiary's
 13  4 interest as provided by Code chapter 633E (uniform disclaimer
 13  5 of property interest Act).
 13  6    To the extent that the transferor's probate estate is
 13  7 insufficient to satisfy an allowed claim against the estate
 13  8 or a statutory allowance to a surviving spouse or child, the
 13  9 estate may enforce the liability against property transferred
 13 10 at the transferor's death by a transfer on death deed.
 13 11    The bill provides an optional form of a transfer on death
 13 12 deed and an optional form for the revocation of a transfer on
 13 13 death deed.
 13 14    The bill does not affect any deed executed and recorded prior
 13 15 to the effective date of the bill and applies to a transfer on
 13 16 death deed made before, on, or after the effective date of the
 13 17 bill by a transferor dying on or after the effective date of
 13 18 the bill.
 13 19    The bill makes conforming changes.
