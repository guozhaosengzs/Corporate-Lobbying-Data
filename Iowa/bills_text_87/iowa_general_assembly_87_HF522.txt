  3 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 26    Currently, Code chapter 544A requires the architectural
  3 27 examining board established within the professional licensing
  3 28 and regulation bureau of the banking division of the department
  3 29 of commerce to regulate the practice of architecture in Iowa.
  3 30 Pursuant to that regulation, a person cannot engage in the
  3 31 practice of architecture in the state unless the person is
  3 32 issued a certificate of registration from the architectural
  3 33 examining board.
  3 34    This bill replaces all terms in Code chapter 544A relating
  3 35 to registration with licensure. Architects must obtain a
  4  1 license from the architectural examining board to engage in the
  4  2 practice of architecture in the state instead of a certificate
  4  3 of registration on or after July 1, 2017.
  4  4    The bill provides that any person who is registered as an
  4  5 architect pursuant to Code chapter 544A on July 1, 2017, is
  4  6 deemed to be licensed to practice as an architect.
  4  7    The bill also makes conforming changes to other Code
  4  8 sections which refer to registration as an architect.

  3 26    Currently, Code chapter 544A requires the architectural
  3 27 examining board established within the professional licensing
  3 28 and regulation bureau of the banking division of the department
  3 29 of commerce to regulate the practice of architecture in Iowa.
  3 30 Pursuant to that regulation, a person cannot engage in the
  3 31 practice of architecture in the state unless the person is
  3 32 issued a certificate of registration from the architectural
  3 33 examining board.
  3 34    This bill replaces all terms in Code chapter 544A relating
  3 35 to registration with licensure. Architects must obtain a
  4  1 license from the architectural examining board to engage in the
  4  2 practice of architecture in the state instead of a certificate
  4  3 of registration on or after July 1, 2017.
  4  4    The bill provides that any person who is registered as an

  4  6 deemed to be licensed to practice as an architect.

  3 26    Currently, Code chapter 544A requires the architectural
  3 27 examining board established within the professional licensing

  3 34    This bill replaces all terms in Code chapter 544A relating
  3 35 to registration with licensure. Architects must obtain a
  4  1 license from the architectural examining board to engage in the
  4  2 practice of architecture in the state instead of a certificate

  3 26    Currently, Code chapter 544A requires the architectural
  3 27 examining board established within the professional licensing
  3 28 and regulation bureau of the banking division of the department
  3 29 of commerce to regulate the practice of architecture in Iowa.
  3 30 Pursuant to that regulation, a person cannot engage in the
  3 31 practice of architecture in the state unless the person is
  3 32 issued a certificate of registration from the architectural
  3 33 examining board.
  3 34    This bill replaces all terms in Code chapter 544A relating
  3 35 to registration with licensure. Architects must obtain a
  4  1 license from the architectural examining board to engage in the
  4  2 practice of architecture in the state instead of a certificate
  4  3 of registration on or after July 1, 2017.
  4  4    The bill provides that any person who is registered as an
  4  5 architect pursuant to Code chapter 544A on July 1, 2017, is
  4  6 deemed to be licensed to practice as an architect.

  3 26    Currently, Code chapter 544A requires the architectural
  3 27 examining board established within the professional licensing
  3 28 and regulation bureau of the banking division of the department
  3 29 of commerce to regulate the practice of architecture in Iowa.
  3 30 Pursuant to that regulation, a person cannot engage in the
  3 31 practice of architecture in the state unless the person is
  3 32 issued a certificate of registration from the architectural
  3 33 examining board.
  3 34    This bill replaces all terms in Code chapter 544A relating
  3 35 to registration with licensure. Architects must obtain a
  4  1 license from the architectural examining board to engage in the
  4  2 practice of architecture in the state instead of a certificate
  4  3 of registration on or after July 1, 2017.

  3 24 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  3 25 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  3 26    Currently, Code chapter 544A requires the architectural
  3 27 examining board established within the professional licensing
  3 28 and regulation bureau of the banking division of the department
  3 29 of commerce to regulate the practice of architecture in Iowa.
  3 30 Pursuant to that regulation, a person cannot engage in the
  3 31 practice of architecture in the state unless the person is
  3 32 issued a certificate of registration from the architectural
  3 33 examining board.
  3 34    This bill replaces all terms in Code chapter 544A relating
  3 35 to registration with licensure. Architects must obtain a
  4  1 license from the architectural examining board to engage in the
  4  2 practice of architecture in the state instead of a certificate
  4  3 of registration on or after July 1, 2017.
