  1  6 The inclusion of this explanation does not constitute agreement with
  1  7 the explanation's substance by the members of the general assembly.
  1  8    This bill relates to sex offender registration for an
  1  9 assault with intent to commit sexual abuse that does not result
  1 10 in a bodily or serious injury to any person.
  1 11    Currently, assault with intent to commit sexual abuse is
  1 12 punishable as an aggravated misdemeanor if no injury results,
  1 13 and that offense is defined as an aggravated offense under Code
  1 14 chapter 692A.  A person who commits an aggravated offense is
  1 15 required to register as a sex offender for life pursuant to
  1 16 Code section 692A.106(5).
  1 17    The bill strikes the criminal offense of assault with intent
  1 18 to commit sexual abuse punishable as an aggravated misdemeanor
  1 19 from the definition of an aggravated offense under Code chapter
  1 20 692A.  Thus, a person who commits such an offense is required
  1 21 to register as a sex offender for 10 years as required in Code
  1 22 section 692A.106(1) and not for life.
  1 23     A person who commits such an offense is also subject to a
  1 24 10=year special sentence under Code section 903B.2.
